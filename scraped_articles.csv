You know, the kind of button-downs that can say both, ""I know the way to Flavortown"" and ""meet me at the skate park."" We're partial to cardigans that look broken in by My Cousin Vinny, but were woven just yesterday. So when I recently came across this *chef’s kiss* bowling button-down, I thought for sure that it must be some Bodega-vetted streetwear brand. It was effortless. It was a balancing act of burgundy, creamy stripes, and relaxed cotton. It was the mid-century deli man shirt of my dreams—and it was made by… Abercrombie & Fitch?

“MA’AM! Where have I been?” I Slacked my coworkers about this plot twist; “Have you seen how good the stuff is on Abercrombie lately?” There wasn’t the same cringe, fake-outdoorsy-preppy energy on their website. Instead, it was replaced with an airy aesthetic that hit a sweet spot between Tony Soprano and a chill uncle from Connecticut. We went from “You can’t sit with us,” to full Gabagool Cool real fast:

The prep element is still there. We’re still standing on bedrock of argyle and houndstooth polos and pullovers, but in a way that feels far more Tommy-Hillfiger-meets-heritage-menswear than 2000s preppy. But it's clear that some major changes—and dare I say, upgrades—have been made since the brand's peak in the late 90s and subsequent downfall in the 2010s.

For starters, the brand has a far more inclusive size range (XXS-XXXL) than it did from 1992 to 2014, when former CEO Mike Jeffries was in charge, and its take on basics has branched out from Frat Boy Brad. “Abercrombie was once mediated through recognition of the brand, and the cultural cache it carried,” a company spokesperson told VICE about this shift, “[and] when Fran Horowitz became our CEO in 2017, she completely turned our company, and the Abercrombie brand, on its head.” In lieu of popped, fuschia polo collars, we now have “Vegan Leather Dad Coats” that lean into normcore aesthetics:

There are old school, long-sleeved rugby tees, and sweater vests just begging for a gorpcore bucket hat:

And don’t forget the smattering of neutral, soft (yet well-tailored) tracksuits that could give Skims a run for its money:

None of this is happenstance, of course. When Jeffries left Abercrombie, the company had some serious soul searching to do; the former CEO’s stewardship had helped turn the brand into an icon of 2000s style, for better and for (much) worse, through hyper-sexualized campaigns, a discriminatory “look policy,” and Jeffries’ proclamation that “a lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.""

I was a 2000s teenager once. Sometimes Gen Zers will ask me if things [points to Tara Reid on US Weekly circa 2007] were “really that rough?” I only went into an actual Abercromie store two or three times in my adolescence, and admittedly, my memories of life in the Fierce Cologne mists of Avalon aren’t great; there was a very real, unspoken social contract that this was where the Hot People came for a Tiësto sound bath, where employees must look like Laguna Beach extras, and that the customers must aspire to that standard. Which is rough, especially if you’re a string bean with a retainer.

Those were the Dark Ages. Everything the brand’s new team has done to move on from that weird period, explained a spokesperson, has been rooted in scaling back, becoming more inclusive, and celebrating what the brand did well in its infancy. When David Abercrombie founded the brand in 1892, it was an outdoor specialty retailer, and the company was all about providing quality camping, hiking, and fishing goods. By the early 20th century, it had established a well-respected brand identity around the ethos of escaping from the city for a jaunt in nature. It wanted young people, even those shopping in banal suburban malls, to feel like an elevated, city mouse in the country; its corduroy, knit, and flannel pieces felt cozy, classic, and as ready for a hike in the woods as they were for the dive bar. New Abercrombie is just Old Abercrombie, but better, because it’s forward-looking:

“We've worked to prove that Abercrombie is not the exclusionary brand of the past,” the Abercrombie rep told me, explaining that the designs we’re seeing now are the product of a new, more symbiotic relationship with consumers combined with the brand’s nod to its heritage pieces, which is a fancy way of saying: They’re giving the people what they want. “We’re dedicated to creating a sense of belonging vs. fitting in and [more] focused on how our customers feel rather than how they look.”

Are there still preppy fits? You bet. But we're happily nostalgic for these looks, even if we weren't big fans of the people who wore them in tenth grade."

Last week, we saw Guess return to its Anna Nicole Smith-worshipping roots, mid-century masterminds and Marimekko team up with Adidas for perfectly patterned athleisure wear, among other shiny new things.

This week, we see Deadhead kitchen accessories, Lisa Simpson walking the Balenciaga runway, and artist/producer Arca making futuristic aviators with Ray-Ban. It's a wacky week for drops and collabs, and we're all about it. Read on, pick up what looks good, and march forth into the autumn breeze.

Balenciaga x The Simpsons

We like that Balenciaga is kind of the weird internet troll of the luxury designer world, from their IKEA-inspired tote bag to their apocalyptic runway shows. As they continue to up the ante, they've pulled the Simpsons into the creative maelstrom, not only launching an entire animated catwalk presentation but also releasing this line of Simpsons swag featuring Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and all the rest. Is it cheap? No. (It’s Balenciaga!) But it’s instantly iconic, and definitely goes in the collab hall of fame.

Grateful Dead x Hedley & Bennett

Us? Mad at how sk8r boi culture has weirdly become obsessed with the Grateful Dead? Nah. We, too, get down with spinning American Beauty while we light up some Dad Grass. In fact, we're downright delighted by cult-fave kitchen-wear brand Hedley & Bennett's new dancing-bear-emblazoned aprons, which are the perfect gift for the Deadhead in your life who also doubles as the barbecue stepdad and the DIY sourdough bread master.

Arca x Ray-Ban Studios

Electronic musician Arca is known for her solo work and production for Björk, Kanye West, Frank Ocean, and FKA Twigs, but this time she takes her avant-garde sensibilities to Ray-Ban's classic aviators. Only 55 pairs are being released online in each style, so make sure to grab yours and wear them to brunch in Bushwick after staying up all night.

Otherland's seasonal Gilded Collection

We don't want to sound, like, cheugy or anything, but even our cynical, atheist asses cannot resist the allure of cozy-weather scented candles. We're not going to run out and buy a bunch of Yankee pumpkin spice jawns or anything, but we can get down with Otherland's annual collection of seasonal scents, which always sells out, and this year includes Old Fashioned (""plum brandy, worn leather, dried fruit"") and Sacred Dusk (""palo santo, crimson incense, cypress bark""). No nutmeg here, just stuff to make chilling at home in the cold weather a little more romantic (and the easiest gift idea ever).

Great Jones x Stagg x Fellow

Those Fellow Stagg EKG gooseneck kettles have become nothing short of a status symbol, and the same could be said for the colorful sheet pans and cookware from Great Jones, so it makes sense that all the brands teamed up and made this broccoli-green electric kettle that will become the essential conversation piece of your kitchen counter.

Yellowpop x Keith Haring

OK, so Keith Haring's pop art has shown up everywhere the last few years, from bongs to Abercrombie shirts. But we've gotta say, we're feeling this collab with Yellowpop, the online store for affordable neon art. We'll take the classic Haring barking dog or the Twisted Man in our effortlessly chic loft apartment, and the LOVE sign in the photobooth of our (currently hypothetical) wedding, because c'mon, that's sweet.

A Jan. 6 Capitol rioter admitted to new crimes he hadn’t been accused of during a court hearing this week, serving as yet another reminder of why you should never try to act as your own lawyer.

Brandon Fellows, a 27-year-old from Albany, New York, was charged with multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, which could land him in prison for up to 20 years. Fellows is accused of entering the Capitol building during the Jan. 6 riot and was caught on video smoking cannabis in Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley’s office.

But on Tuesday, while testifying in his own bond hearing—he admitted to preparing for the wrong kind of hearing—Fellows accidentally described to the court actions that could constitute more crimes: He admitted to listing the phone number of a New York state judge’s wife as his own in an attempt to get the judge dismissed from the case, based on a supposed “loophole” he read about online, according to Courthouse News.

Fellows also admitted to asking his lawyer if he should do that in his federal case. Fellows testified that his lawyer told him: “You did not find a loophole, Brandon, I promise you. If you do this with Judge [Trevor] McFadden, you will be arrested.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Fellows’ motion to have his bond status revoked was denied. McFadden told Fellows that he admitted to obstruction of justice and perjury on the stand.

“You’ve admitted to incredible lapses of judgment here on the stand, not least of which was seeking to disqualify a New York state judge,” McFadden, a U.S. District Court judge nominated by former President Donald Trump, told Fellows.

“You’ve engaged in a pattern of behaviors that shows contempt for the criminal justice system, and I just have no confidence that you will follow my orders if I release you.”

Fellows is one of several accused Capitol rioters who’ve fired their lawyers and chosen to represent themselves in court. He did so despite being repeatedly warned by his former public defender and by McFadden that doing so was a bad idea. Fellows did it anyway.

“Although, as Justice Blackmun says, I may be a fool to represent myself, I am nowhere near as big a fool as Joe Biden,” Fellows told the court last month.

Fellows was allowed out on bail, but he was rearrested in July after prosecutors said rambling, obscene voicemail messages for his pretrial services officer and her mother."
https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/93ye7z/the-anti-vax-movement-cant-wait-for-kyrie-irving-to-be-its-idol,"['irvings', 'antivaccine', 'nba', 'health', 'conspiracy', 'week', 'wait', 'movement', 'vaccine', 'black', 'cant', 'idol', 'irving', 'kyrie', 'mandates', 'antivax']","The Brooklyn Nets and their star player, Kyrie Irving, have continued an awkward dance this week: Irving doesn’t want to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and Nets leadership desperately doesn’t want to keep him off the court long term. He can't play in New York due to local mandates, though, and the team is unwilling to let him play part-time. Meanwhile, the leading lights of the anti-vaccine movement are eagerly keeping tabs on the battle, clearly hoping Irving will be the figurehead for the battle against vaccine mandates they’ve been waiting for.

Irving has become the biggest COVID vaccine holdout in the NBA, but hasn’t outlined the specific reasons for his refusal. An incredibly embarrassing piece of stenography in The Athletic this week attempted to “clarify” his stance by speaking to people “with direct knowledge” of Irving’s decision-making. (These people sounded a lot like they work in public relations and were trying to spin his decision in a way that would not put the phrase “anti-vaccine” in headlines next to Irving’s name.) Those unnamed inside sources told the publication that Irving is “not anti-vaccine and that his stance is that he is upset that people are losing their jobs due to vaccine mandates...To him, this is about a grander fight than the one on the court, and Irving is challenging a perceived control of society and people’s livelihood,” in The Athletic’s tortured phrasing.

All of this is very exciting for the far right, as VICE News has reported: Characters like Candace Owens and Donald Trump Jr. have voiced their support for Irving’s refusal, even after excoriating other things he’s previously stood for, including support for Black Lives Matter and supporting the water protectors who stood against the Dakota Access Pipeline on Standing Rock Sioux land.

But it’s even more thrilling for the anti-vaccine movement and the broader movement of health conspiracy theorists around them, who would like more basis for their continued insistence that COVID vaccine mandates are an infringement on the public’s civil rights and/or a globalist plot to enslave the human race. If Irving were benched all season for a team with championship aspirations, it would make for a very convenient talking point, which is why, across fringe publications and toxic Telegram channels, his decision-making is being tracked and supported. The author and health conspiracy theorist David Avocado Wolfe called Irving “the smartest guy in the NBA,” while the pseudo-scientific “health” site Health Impact News, which frequently traffics in conspiracy theories and bogus claims, praised Irving for “giving up over $100 million” to refuse the shot. (That’s not correct, but the decision is an expensive one: Irving is ineligible to play as long as he refuses the shot, and reportedly stands to lose $380,000 for missing a pre-season game. He may lose up to $15 million this season, CNN reports.)

Health Impact News editor Brian Shilhavy likened the NBA to “slave masters” and wrote, “The real reason the NBA and Nets are making this decision, is that they cannot afford the PR nightmare that would ensue for allowing an 'anti-vaxxer' to tour to other NBA cities and become a beacon of light for those who refuse to bow to the Globalists and their eugenics agenda.”

Irving’s own silence about why he doesn’t want to get vaccinated has allowed various people to pin their own motivations onto his decision. In a lengthy Instagram live video, Irving offered some general reasoning, involving an opposition to vaccine mandates and to being told what to do with his own body.

“Pay attention to what’s going on out in the real world,” he said, in part. “People are losing their jobs to these mandates. People are having to make choices with their own lives, which I respect.” He implied that he’d been told he’d be able to get an exemption, adding “What would you do? If you felt uncomfortable going into the season when you were promised that you would have exemptions or that you didn’t have to be forced to get the vaccine?” He added, a moment later: “This is one body that I get here, one God body that I get here. And you’re telling me what to do with my body?”

""It's not about being anti-vax or about being on one side or the other. It's about being true to what feels good for me,"" he said. (Refusing to take a safe, effective vaccine at a cost of millions of dollars and making an enormous public show of it seems, of course, to meet a reasonable definition of side-taking and being anti-vax.)

The site Green Med Info, another hub for health conspiracy theories, shared a link to a summary of Irving’s Instagram comments on Telegram, praising them as “EPIC.”

This isn’t Irving’s first foray into out-there ideas: He previously generated controversy for suggesting on a podcast that the Earth might be flat, before apologizing. This time, Irving seems to be taking some ideas from a fringe Instagrammer, as Rolling Stone’s Matt Sullivan reported, “liking Instagram posts from a conspiracy theorist who claims that ‘secret societies’ are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for ‘a plan of Satan.’” (The idea that vaccines are a “death plan” or a depopulation scheme for Black people is something that the Nation of Islam began promoting in the 1960s. While vaccine skepticism is not generally more common in Black communities, both Black and Latinx people are less likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and more likely to be hospitalized with the disease. That’s due in part to a suspicion of the medical establishment because of the United States’ toxic legacy of medical racism and experimentation against those populations.)

A Black conspiracy influencer named Behizy, who’s recently spent more time trafficking in false claims on Gab and Telegram that the 2020 presidential elections were stolen, offered more praise for Irving, writing, “If Kyrie Irving’s teammates have any integrity and honor left, they should join him. #HoldTheLineKyrie.”

The phrasing “Hold the Line” is not coincidental; it’s also what anti-vaccine personalities have been urging Southwest pilots to do. The airline canceled thousands of flights this week citing bad weather and staffing issues; as the Associated Press reported, conservative politicians and anti-vaccine groups quickly began claiming that the airline’s staff were staging a “sickout” protest over vaccine mandates. (Southwest denies this, though how convincing you find the denial is possibly a matter of perspective.) The hashtag #holdtheline quickly became a rallying cry to urge them to refuse to get vaccinated.

Chaos, strife, and division over vaccine requirements are ultimately what the anti-vaccine movement wants, and high-profile dissenters like Irving serve those goals. This is perhaps why it's focusing less on the comments of Irving’s teammates who got vaccinated without incident and quietly moved on to doing their jobs, without added risk to each other, their staff, or their fans. That includes James Harden, who said in a press conference this week, “Kyrie believes in his beliefs, and he stands firm and strong on that. And for us, we respect it. We all love Ky. But as far as us, we have a job to do.”"

A grainy photo of a lone Kellogg’s factory worker holding a picket sign in a torrential downpour has gone viral on social media, amid a 1,400-worker strike that has shut down all of Kellogg’s ready-to-eat cereal factories in the United States.

The person in that photo is Jason Schultz, a 44-year-old forklift operator who works in packaging at the Kellogg’s factory in Omaha, Nebraska, where workers have been on strike since October 5. The factory makes 27 products, including Fruit Loops, Frosted Flakes, Corn Flakes, Special K, and Corn Pops.

When a rainstorm swept through Omaha this week, gusty winds blew union tents over, and many workers headed to their cars for shelter, but Schultz decided to stay on the picket and get drenched.

“I decided to stay out there because we had cars coming by, and that’s why we’re out there, to make sure everyone knows we’re not leaving,” Schultz told Motherboard. We are prepared to stay out one day longer than the company if that's what it takes.”

A strike capitain, Schultz, is in charge of ensuring that one of the factory’s six gates is manned 24/7 during the strike. This is for increasing the strike’s visibility to cars and people passing by, but also to prevent other workers from crossing their picket line, which is a violation of unionized workers’ contracts. (Kellogg’s has reportedly hired replacement workers, known as “scabs” to keep production going during the strike.)

Kellogg’s workers shut down factories in Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Michigan last week after their union negotiators and the company failed to reach a contract agreement.

The company wants to expand a two-tier employment system, which offers less pay and benefits to new hires. Workers, whose union is the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers International Union, worry that soon the company will push all workers into the lower tier.

Schultz said that 10 years ago, he followed his father to work at Kellogg’s in Omaha because it was a good-paying, secure job in the area. But things have since gone downhill. “I can’t say it’s what it used to be,” he said. “They’ve taken a lot away from new hires coming in, but we’re trying to get it back. It’s a good job if we get it equal again.”

These cuts coincide with severe understaffing, and managers forcing them to work overtime during the pandemic without a day off for months. During the pandemic. Schultz told Motherboard that he did not receive a day off for months, including weekends.

Meanwhile, Kellogg’s business has boomed during the COVID-19 lockdown. Last year, Kellogg’s CEO, Steve Cahillane, took home more than $11.6 million.

Kellogg’s strikers are receiving $105 a week from the union’s strike fund for the duration of the strike, not nearly enough to make ends meet. Workers are also receiving donations to their strike funds.

“We’ve got a lot of people who saved up ahead of time for the strike,” Shultz said. “Others have gotten part-time jobs. We’ve stressed to guys on the line that if they need to get a job, they can do that, because family comes first.”

Shultz said that between his shifts manning the gate, helping out other shifts, and taking care of his four step-kids at home, he hasn’t slept more than 30 minutes in the past three days."

Texas Republicans just keep passing bills about nonexistent problems.

On Thursday, the Texas state House voted to pass a law that will require K-12 public schools students to compete on sports teams that match the sex listed on their birth certificate. Currently, the University Interscholastic League, which oversees Texas school sports, accepts birth certificates that have been amended later in life; under this new bill, the only acceptable birth certificates would have to be received at or near the time of birth.

In other words, the bill would target transgender and intersex students’ ability to participate in sports that match their gender identity. And this is the fourth time this year that an arm of the Texas state Legislature, which is dominated by the GOP, has tried to pass a bill targeting trans and intersex kids in sports.

“Radical policies like the anti-transgender sports ban bill that target children for no reason other than to score political points, making the state less safe and desirable for families to live and work, putting businesses in the state at a competitive disadvantage,” Human Rights Campaign Texas State Director Rebecca Marques said in a statement. “Rather than focusing on urgent needs for Texans like fixing the fragile, failing electrical grid during three special sessions, the Legislature was hellbent on advancing a discriminatory and harmful agenda just to appease their primary base.”

Lawmakers in dozens of states this year introduced legislation that targeted trans and intersex kids. Several of these bills were aimed at cutting off their ability to access gender-affirming health care, while others, like the Texas legislation, were intended to restrict their ability to participate in school sports.

Multiple analyses have concluded, however, that there are relatively few trans youth athletes participating in sports. State legislators have also struggled to name instances where trans girls—a particular focus of these bills—were participating in sports. But Republicans have seized on trans children’s rights as a “culture war” issue that will animate their conservative voter base, even though bills targeting trans youth athletes are unpopular nationally.

There is also evidence that LGBTQ kids’ mental health is in real danger. A 2018 study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that almost half of trans female teenagers said they had attempted suicide. That number rose among trans male teenagers, as more than half said that they had tried to die of suicide. More than 40 percent of nonbinary young people said the same.

“If you care about mental health, and I know you do, then do this simple thing and not advance this piece of harmful legislation,” Texas state Rep. Mary E. González told legislators on the House floor Thursday, according to the Texas Tribune. “We actually also know that this is a nonissue, that there is no issue with transgender and intersex students playing sports.”"

A U.S. Capitol Police officer was arrested Friday for allegedly warning a rioter to destroy evidence that they’d made it into the Capitol on January 6.

Officer Michael A. Riley, an officer with more than two decades on the force, was charged with obstruction of justice for Facebook messaging an alleged rioter and warning them to delete posts that said they’d been in the Capitol. Riley is the first Capitol officer who’s been arrested for charges stemming from the January 6 riots, according to the U.S. Capitol Police.

According to the indictment, Riley friended a man on Facebook who’d posted selfies and other evidence that he was in the Capitol during the riots and warned him to take the posts down so as to avoid possible charges.

He identified himself as a Capitol officer “who agrees with your political stance,” and told him to “take down the part about being in the building.”

When that individual was charged, Riley warned him of the charges and had a 23-minute phone call. That person then told others that his and their charges would only involve trespassing. At one point someone else sent Riley a video of that man smoking weed in Congress, and Riley said he already knew about it.

“Next time you want to come to D.C., just call me. You can stay at my house on the shore for free and bring your daughter to the museums. If you want to see the capitol building lets do it legally next time… i know a guy who can get you a tour...lol,” Riley sent in one message. “Its behind you now...lesson learned!”

Riley and the man continued to exchange friendly messages for more than two weeks. When the man warned Riley that he’d told the FBI of their conversations, Riley then deleted all of their Facebook direct messages. He seemingly tried to cover up for his previous actions by claiming the man had misled him about how he wound up in the building and blasted him for “smoking weed and acting like a moron” in the Capitol before saying he wouldn’t be in touch with him anymore.

Riley was arraigned Friday afternoon on two charges of obstruction of justice, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and $250,000 fines. He’s hired David Benowitz, a D.C. criminal attorney who’s represented multiple Capitol riot defendants, as his counsel. He was released pending trial and is due back in court on October 26.

The Capitol Police said they placed Riley on administrative leave Friday upon his arrest.

“Obstruction of Justice is a very serious allegation. The Department was notified about this investigation several weeks ago,” U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said in a statement. “Upon his arrest, the officer was placed on administrative leave pending the completion of the case. The USCP’s Office of Professional Responsibility will then open an administrative investigation.”

Riley currently serves on the Capitol Police’s K-9 Unit. He was named “Officer of the Month” back in 2011 for performing CPR on another injured officer.

While Riley is the first Capitol officer who’s been arrested for charges stemming from the January 6 riots, he’s not the only one who’s come under suspicion of aiding the rioters."

https://www.wired.com/2021/10/geeks-guide-social-media-panic/,"['overblown', 'does', 'media', 'im', 'soave', 'social', 'panic', 'lot', 'group', 'right', 'facebook', 'shouldnt']","In his new book Tech Panic: Why We Shouldn’t Fear Facebook and the Future, Robby Soave questions the conventional wisdom which says that social media represents an unprecedented threat to the well-being of America’s youth.

“I think there’s been a lot of panicking about social media that’s disproportionate to the actual harm,” Soave says in Episode 488 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “A lot of this is hyperbole; a lot of this is overblown.”

He says the current furor over social media is reminiscent of the way politicians talked about video games like Doom and Mortal Kombat back in the ’90s. “Everything that was said about video games 20 years ago turned out not to be true—they don’t promote violence, they don’t turn young men into school shooters,” he says. “And I wonder if 10 or 20 years from now we’ll look back at this moral panic in a similar way.”

Much has been made over the power of algorithms developed by Facebook and Google, which Soave says recalls earlier panics over the danger of subliminal advertising. “I like that when I’m on Facebook, I’m getting [ads for] Dungeons & Dragons merchandise rather than commercials for cars,” he says. “If I watch TV, I get commercials for cars. I’m not going to buy a car. Not relevant to me. I wish I could fast-forward through them. On Facebook I see things I might actually like. That’s a good thing.”

Tech companies are taking fire from across the political spectrum, with everyone from Donald Trump and Senator Josh Hawley to President Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren calling for new regulations. Soave says it would be a huge mistake to let politicians exert too much power over one of America’s most innovative industries. “Maybe for a lot of people, they go, ‘Well, if everyone in government wants this, that means it’s right,’ whereas I go the opposite way—if everyone wants this, it’s definitely bad,” he says.

Listen to the complete interview with Robby Soave in Episode 488 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.

Robby Soave on Dungeons & Dragons:

“Right now I’m [dungeon mastering] two groups, and I’m playing in a third, although that one came to an end and I think they’re going to rapture my character into a different group. So there’s a lot of overlap between my various worlds and characters. It’s so much fun … Because I write for a libertarian magazine, my primary group is very libertarian in play style. The other group tacks a bit further to the right. The main difference I’ve noticed is that the group that tacks further to the right does like combat and killing everything they encounter, and killing characters I come up with, whereas the libertarians want to talk their way—or exchange things—out of every situation. They will avoid combat at all costs.”

Robby Soave on cancel culture:

“I’ve written a lot about cases of what people call ‘cancel culture,’ of people coming under attack or criticism for having written something or done something that was maybe insensitive or offensive in some way, but they didn’t kill someone—it shouldn’t be the end of their lives … It’s very weird, especially for the progressive left, who often believe in criminal justice reform, which is something I support—the idea that formerly incarcerated people should be able to live normal lives, and they should be able to get jobs again, and you shouldn’t necessarily have to ask them about their incarceration status—you can be forgiven. Which I totally agree with, but then someone who said something maybe racist when they were 15, and you found the tweet, they should never be employed again? That makes no sense to me.”

Robby Soave on the media:

“Really the villain of my book is actually the mainstream media and The New York Times in particular … You can go back through time, and every invention, especially in the communication space, you can find them absolutely panicked about it … But it makes sense from an industry’s perspective, because a lot of these technologies were perceived by The New York Times, by the newspapers, as a competitor.”

Robby Soave on Silicon Valley:

“The culture of Silicon Valley has become somewhat hostile to innovation, and it has made people leave [California]. My point in bringing that up was, let’s not repeat that nationally. The anti-tech rhetoric coming from everyone in Congress is so totalizing. They are treating social media like Big Tobacco right now—we heard that over and over again. But Big Tobacco has killed millions of people, and even the most serious accusations against Instagram, no one thinks it’s killed hundreds of people. So it’s a ridiculous comparison. This kind of knee-jerk anti-tech sentiment coming from policymakers and lawmakers does not serve our country well, does not serve our society well, and does not serve innovation well.”

https://www.wired.com/2021/10/geeks-guide-snow-crash/,"['miller', 'interesting', 'think', 'cyberpunk', 'cool', 'classic', 'crash', 'book', 'snow', 'lot', 'really', 'kind']","Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash is one of the most popular sci-fi books of all time, and together with William Gibson’s Neuromancer it stands as a foundational text of the cyberpunk movement. Science fiction author Anthony Ha was blown away by Snow Crash when he first read it back in the late ’90s.

“This was a period when there were some clunky representations of virtual reality in movies and TV,” Ha says in Episode 487 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “So it wasn’t that Snow Crash was the first time I encountered that kind of iconography, but it was the first time it actually seemed cool.”

Snow Crash tells the story of Hiro Protagonist, a katana-wielding hacker who jumps back and forth between dystopian Los Angeles and a virtual world called the Metaverse. Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley notes that the novel has inspired countless entrepreneurs and inventors, including John Carmack, Reid Hoffman, and Palmer Luckey. “I started making a list of everyone in Silicon Valley who’s cited this work as inspiring them,” Kirtley says, “and I just kind of stopped at a certain point, because it was basically everyone.”

Snow Crash is still as fun and stylish as ever, but some aspects of the book have dated poorly. Science fiction professor Lisa Yaszek says that from the vantage of 2021, the book has some weaknesses when it comes to race and gender. “If you’re someone who wants to learn a lot about the history and development of cyberpunk, I do still think it’s important to read, because it is an important intervention,” she says. “It’s the moment before cyberpunk really becomes a global storytelling mode, where all kinds of people—authors of color, LGBTQ+ authors—are really going to start using it.”

Science fiction author Sam J. Miller notes that the characters in Snow Crash also feel a bit thin, to the extent that a robotic guard dog named Rat Thing stands out as one of the book’s most sympathetic characters. “In a lot of ways I think that Rat Thing might be the character who comes the closest to having heart, and an emotional arc, and who made me really feel things,” Miller says. “Everybody else is like, they’ve got three pairs of sunglasses on they’re so cool.”

Listen to the complete interview with Anthony Ha, Lisa Yaszek, and Sam J. Miller in Episode 487 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.

David Barr Kirtley on character development:

“Hiro seemed interesting, and he had this interesting background with his parents, and Y.T. had this relationship with her mom. But I felt like as the book went on the character development just kind of dropped out. We never really saw much of Juanita or Da5id—I mean, he’s in a coma but he could have come out of it. There were so many characters and so many organizations, and it got really, really complicated. It’s all cool, everything in this book is super cool, but I did kind of feel like the characterization [was lacking]. There was no emotional vulnerability or heart-to-heart moments really, or people feeling regrets or anything like that. It just felt very on the surface.”

Anthony Ha on backstory:

“The problem is that if you’re reading the book for the plot, the [backstory] becomes a distraction, where at key, climactic moments, suddenly Hiro will jump back to the library and have a discussion about [ancient Sumeria] with the Librarian when he’s about to have another sword fight or something like that. So especially on a first read, especially if you’re younger, I think your foot is just kind of tapping impatiently like, ‘Why am I reading this?’ … It’s a cool MacGuffin for the story, it was interesting learning about Sumerian mythology, but there were times when it felt like a lot of words just to have Stephenson essentially say, ‘Man, isn’t language just like a virus? Isn’t that cool?’ And I was like, ‘It is cool, but it’s not maybe worth quite so many words.'”

Sam J. Miller on floating cities:

“One of the things I did prior to writing Blackfish City was I visited—in Cambodia—a community of folks who are primarily Vietnamese refugees, who are essentially a floating community. They have a church, and a school, and all these things on floats, and they have a convenience store that sells lottery tickets and gasoline, and they have alligator farms. It’s amazing, and it’s also deeply tragic, and not a super high standard of living. In large part they’re there because their ability to live on land—because of immigration issues—is limited. [Floating cities] are a cool idea, but I think in practice it’s the kind of scenario that would only evolve by necessity, and would probably not be super great.”

Lisa Yaszek on economics:

“What’s interesting is the use that people put the virus to, which is to appropriate bodies for the production of goods that don’t go to those bodies themselves. So [Snow Crash] is thinking as much about labor as it is thinking about language, and that’s the part of it that I still find interesting. … In a lot of ways I think it’s a response to William Gibson. I like it because I’m a sucker for utopian thinking, but I think Gibson is often naively utopian about the ability of marginalized communities to resist incorporation and destruction by promissory engagement with capitalism. I think part of what this book does, and what I like, is that it explores how likely that would be—can you really stay out of the nets of capitalism or not?”

Science fiction author Matthew Kressel says he loves watching classic fantasy movies like Krull, in spite of the slow pacing and dated special effects.

“I know it’s really cheesy, and corny at parts, but there’s something about the world of that film that draws me in every time,” Kressel says in Episode 486 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “I watched that movie with my cousin, who’s no longer alive, and I have an emotional attachment to it. Every time I watch it, I’m back as a kid in that theater watching it.”

Humor writer Tom Gerencer says that for adults who grew up in the ’80s, nothing can compare to the magic of watching Heavy Metal or Highlander. “You’re kind of imprinted like a bird,” he says. “If they’re around a human when they hatch out, they think they’re a human, and when you’re forming your young self and you watch these movies, they just get into a part of your psyche that closes when you’re older.”

The Princess Bride is the rare example of an ’80s fantasy movie that’s just as fresh and exciting today as when it was released. TV writer Andrea Kail says that many parts of the movie actually resonate more for her as an adult than they did when she was younger. “There’s this one line where Buttercup says, ‘You mock my pain,’ and Westley goes, ‘Life is pain. Anyone who says differently is selling something,'” Kail says. “It’s funny, but it’s also real. Especially as an adult, you’re like, ‘Yup.'”

Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley wishes studios would make more movies like Conan the Barbarian or Willow. “I love sword and sorcery so much, and I’m so happy I grew up with it,” he says. “These movies overwhelmingly were not well done, but there’s something so awesome about the whole sword and sorcery thing, and it makes me sad the extent to which it’s passed away. I wish more new movies would take this kind of story and do it better, with modern pacing and modern special effects.”

Listen to the complete interview with Matthew Kressel, Tom Gerencer, and Andrea Kail in Episode 486 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.

Matthew Kressel on Labyrinth:

“If you notice, when the clock strikes 13—which is really midnight—she’s at the bottom of the stairs, and the scene before that was when they were walking through all those M. C. Escher stairs. So I was like, ‘Oh, they’re basically playing with this idea that the whole thing was just her way of spending time with herself.’ This is, I think, a Gen X and earlier thing, because I think younger generations don’t really have that boredom. But there could be a time, at least when I was growing up, where there was nothing to do. There was nothing on TV. ‘What do I do? I don’t know.’ And then you just play in your imagination—or at least I did.”

Andrea Kail on cinematography:

“A good portion of the reason [that Ladyhawke is so slow] was the DP is Vittorio Storaro, who is one of the most famous DPs of all time—he was the DP on Apocalypse Now, so talk about long beautiful shots. I think they probably indulged him, so that might have had something to do with it. But I can’t tolerate [long shots] either. I just watched a movie called The Leopard, which is based on a classic Sicilian novel. It’s 1963, and it was painful. This is a movie that won awards all over the place in 1963, and it’s all just long, long single shots of people walking. I was clenching my fists. I’m like, ‘What are you doing? Move the freaking story.’ That is how we are. Our attention spans have been cut short at this point.”

Tom Gerencer on The Princess Bride:

“So many of the lines just pop into my head at random times during the day. ‘So long, have fun storming the castle!’ I mean, any time I say goodbye to somebody, that pops into my head. … I’m on this text thread with three of my high school friends, where we message each other all the time—multiple times a day—and a couple of weeks ago I ran across this great meme, which I had seen before, with one of those stickers that you put on when you’re at a conference. It says, ‘Hello, my name is,’ and then there’s a blank, and somebody had written in ‘Inigo Montoya. You kill my father, prepare to die!’ I screenshotted it, and I posted it to that thread, and it launched this lively discussion where they’re like, ‘That’s awesome! That’s so funny!’ And they started talking about other Princess Bride quotes.”

Tom Gerencer on William Goldman:

“After I saw The Princess Bride, I went and read the book and was just blown away, when I found out he wrote the movie script too, by how good of a job he did on his own book, adapting it, which you know, if you’ve looked into other authors who’ve done that, is not an easy thing. … If you read the book, and you see the parts he cut out, and you see what he transitioned from narrative into dialog and action, it’s astounding the job he did. It should almost be taught in film schools—people should have to read the book and then watch this movie and look at the screenplay, and just be like, ‘So that’s how that’s done.'”

“I wish I could claim that this idea was original with me, but actually I got the inspiration from the first political theory class I took as an undergraduate,” Reisert says in Episode 485 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “The professor at that time assigned a political theory class that began with Plato and ended with Brave New World, and he made a lot of the connections for us then that I try to bring out when I teach it in my class.”

Reisert says that science fiction can help us imagine scenarios that we would never consider otherwise. “Science fiction enables us to try out, in literature, very different sets of social arrangements,” he says, “and through the medium of story maybe even get beyond that reflexive, ‘It’s different so it must be bad,’ and sort of play out in our heads, ‘Well, could this work? What would that mean? If we change this thing, what happens to these other things?’ I think fiction does that really well.”

Reisert is currently teaching Ursula K. Le Guin’s novel The Dispossessed to help students understand Marxist ideas of a society without private property. “It’s the one imagining of a society without property that seems reasonably plausible to me,” he says. “I love that novel, and I think the central insight there is that to make that society without property work, even apart from the organizational challenges, requires a kind of moral transformation that’s not easy to accomplish.”

Another advantage of science fiction novels is that they tend to be more entertaining than political treatises, meaning that students are more likely to actually read them. “One shouldn’t underestimate the importance of having a light, easy reading at the end of a long semester right before people take exams,” Reisert says.

Listen to the complete interview with Joseph Reisert in Episode 485 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.

Joseph Reisert on Star Trek:

“Even as a kid I knew it was progressive—there’s still the Cold War going on and there’s a Russian on the bridge, and it’s interracial. But what struck me as a kid, and what I still really like about it is the optimism of the vision. I just found that so appealing, and the sort of mediating balance among [the characters]. If you think of Kirk as courage or spiritedness, and Spock as reason or intelligence, and McCoy as basically heart or friendship, all three of them turn out to be necessary. There are at least a few original series episodes where they come upon an apparently perfect but stagnant society that [puts] limits on intellectual inquiry, assertiveness, exploration, and daring, and the Enterprise folks bring it down.”

Joseph Reisert on Brave New World:

“[Bernard] is trying to impress Lenina Crowne by taking her to the Savage Reservation, and that’s where they meet John and Linda, and they bring them back to London. … When Linda dies, John kind of snaps and his disgust at the Brave New World is unleashed, and so he decides he’s going to liberate the Delta caste workers at the hospice for the dying by throwing away their drug ration. ‘Be men! Be free!’ he shouts to them. A riot ensues, and you’ve got to love the Brave New World, they break it up by foaming everyone with soma gas, and I think they have anesthetic water pistols so people fall asleep. And there’s the big, booming voice of their hypnotic instruction urging them to start an orgy. I think it actually ends with an orgy, this riot.”

Joseph Reisert on free speech:

“I definitely am pretty close to a free speech absolutist. Part of it is that anything I see being censored by somebody, I usually regard that as a reason to [think], ‘Well maybe I should look again at that idea, because somebody’s really afraid of it.’ It’s just so offensive to adults to say, ‘You can’t hear this’ or ‘You can’t hear that,’ and I think politically it’s just deeply corrosive. I think it’s much better to let people talk, because if they stop talking the next thing is violence. … There is a kind of—I don’t even think it’s a large group, but there’s a kind of loud, censorious, progressive set of students who really can’t abide having their pieties challenged at all, and they can make life difficult for people who would even want to talk about alternative perspectives, let alone actually embrace them. And I think that just has to be resisted at all costs.”

Joseph Reisert on Brave New World vs. Nineteen Eighty-Four:

“Even though I don’t altogether agree with [Mustapha Mond’s] defense of the Brave New World, he in some ways embodies all the virtues that nobody else in the Brave New World is really allowed to cultivate. … When O’Brien [in Nineteen Eighty-Four] is eating real chocolate or having real coffee, in a weird sort of way he’s tasting the sorrow of the other party. The point of it for him is the sadistic boot-on-face-forever. Whereas Mond is kind of wistful. ‘If they read Othello, they couldn’t understand it, and it would unsettle them. Yeah it would be nice if they could have real art, but the price would be too high.’ It’s not like he’s enjoying the deprivation of others, which is the vibe I get from Nineteen Eighty-Four.”

“It’s great to have a job where you get permission to feed your hobby and buy as many books as you want, and so I keep buying neuroscience books,” Gregory says in Episode 484 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “I’m endlessly fascinated by that stuff, and so I’m always looking for ways to make that into stories.”

In his story “Dead Horse Point,” a genius physicist suffers from a strange condition that causes her to disappear into her own mind for weeks at a time. Gregory says the story was inspired by a friend of his. “He wasn’t completely dysfunctional like the character in my story, but he was a really gifted mathematician, and when he was working on a hard problem, he would—for days at a time—he would drift around, he would eat automatically, he would barely talk to people,” Gregory says. “He had to stop doing that when he had kids, because you can’t just walk away from your children and come back three days later and see if they’re OK.”

One of the most fascinating stories in the book is “Second Person, Present Tense,” in which a teenager takes a drug that disrupts the connection between her conscious mind and the rest of her brain. “She overdoses on this drug,” Gregory says, “and then a new consciousness sort of steps in, and she knows exactly what happened—she has access even to the old person’s memories—but her identity does not feel like that person. She feels like a new consciousness.”

Gregory thought the idea was complete fiction, but later learned it’s something that can actually happen. “I got an email from a guy who’s a professor, and he’s like, ‘I read this story, and this happened to me, except it wasn’t a drug, it was a motorcycle accident. When I woke up in the hospital, I knew I was a different person, but I wasn’t as brave as your protagonist—I kept faking my way through it,'” Gregory says. “He just was trying to get by, even though he knew he had nothing to do with that previous person who had the motorcycle accident.”

Daryl Gregory on his story “The Continuing Adventures of Rocket Boy”:

“[Gordon Van Gelder] did me a great service on ‘The Continuing Adventures of Rocket Boy,’ which is in the collection, and which Gordon published. … He actually said, ‘Look, this is not actually a science fiction story. It’s a mainstream story about science fiction. So I just can’t take it, I can’t buy the story.’ And I said, ‘Yeah, that makes sense.’ But I said, ‘You know, I really hope that people in science fiction would read it, because it’s about me as a reader, growing up.’ I went on to write other stories for Gordon, and then he came back to me and said, ‘Look, I can’t stop thinking about that story. Let’s run it.’ And he did run it, but with a disclaimer—not for sex or violence, but for the disturbing lack of genre content.”

Daryl Gregory on his novel Revelator:

“I’m really interested in the idea of gods that aren’t quite gods, demons that aren’t really demons. So like in this new book Revelator, there’s a family in the Smoky Mountains, in the 1930s and ’40s, and for generations they’ve been worshiping their own private god, and they’ve declared it a god, but what is it really? One of the mysteries of the book is, ‘Well, what is this thing? We’ve sort of made it into a god, and it’s doing things, and it seems to be supernatural, but is there another, science fiction explanation for it?’ … One of the secrets of the book is that it’s a crypto science fiction novel. I wrote it in such a way that it feels like horror and fantasy, but there’s a scientific explanation for every single thing that’s going on in the story.”

Daryl Gregory on Roger Zelazny:

“I grew up reading people like Roger Zelazny who would mix science fiction and fantasy. … Zelazny wrote this great novel that had such an influence on me called Lord of Light, where it’s basically a science fiction space opera about a far future civilization that crash landed—we learn later they came in a ship—but their high tech, for some of the original crew members, makes them into gods, and they assume aspects of the Hindu pantheon. It’s fantastic. It blew my mind when I read it sophomore year of high school, and when you read something at that age, it can carve a deep groove into your brain. And so part of me still, years later, wants to be Roger Zelazny more than anything. I want to grow up to be him.”

Daryl Gregory on his novella The Album of Dr. Moreau:

“I thought, ‘OK, all the suspects are going to be these human-animal hybrids—there’s a bat boy and an elephant boy, and all of them are going to be suspects.’ … I had these five guys who were born on a secret science barge and raised by evil genetic engineers, and they’d spent all this time together, and so finding out how they would talk to each other, like brothers, and how each of them would have a distinct personality, that was the most fun of the book. So before I ever started really any of the plot, I would sit and let them talk to each other—I would just keep typing, trying to come up with dialogue — and that’s where I found the book, was in these five guys, the way they would bicker, and how each of them would be funny in a different way.”

Cevasco enjoyed some aspects of the film, but ultimately found it hard to connect with. “There are definitely elements of this that will stay with me—really powerful visual scenes that will haunt me,” he says. “But ultimately that’s about all I will remember about this movie, is those visuals. Everything else is already fading from my memory.”

Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley warns that The Green Knight is strictly for the art house crowd. “This is a movie where if people were like, ‘Should I go see this movie?’ I would say, ‘How do you feel about pretentious movies?'” he says. “If you like pretentious movies, absolutely go see it. One hundred percent. And if you hate pretentious movies and can’t stand them, don’t go see this, you’re not going to like it at all.”

Fantasy author Erin Lindsey had mixed feelings about The Green Knight, but appreciated that it had a strong artistic vision. “I would like to see more of this,” she says. “I would like to see more fantasy that really swings for the fences, and doesn’t regurgitate the same old stuff over and over.”

David Barr Kirtley on David Lowery:

“I had super-high expectations for [The Green Knight], but on my first viewing I was really exasperated with it. I came home, and my girlfriend Steph said, ‘How was it?’ And I was like, ‘Oh, it drove me crazy. Do you know what it reminded me of? Do you remember that movie A Ghost Story that we watched?’ It’s this super-pretentious ghost movie. I was like, ‘It reminded me so much of that. It was so slow.’ And Steph says, ‘Who directed it?’ And I said, ‘This guy David Lowery. I’m not sure who he is.’ So I look him up and he’s the guy who directed A Ghost Story. And it was like, ‘OK, that makes a lot of sense.'”

Christopher M. Cevasco on ambiguity:

“I think a fair interpretation of all of the trials and travails that [Gawain] has along the way is that they’re all basically Morgan or Merlin manifesting. Otherwise how does he get the belt back even though he lost it? His horse comes back even though it was taken by the bandits. It’s because this is all part of this big thing that they’re creating. But then why are they throwing obstacles in his path? Why are they giving him things back? I don’t know. I don’t have any answers. I don’t know that there are any answers. And it may be that my interpretation is not the interpretation the director had, maybe none of our interpretations are. We just don’t know. And that’s a problem.”

Erin Lindsey on storytelling:

“I understand why [The Green Knight] is polarizing, but I definitely didn’t experience an extreme reaction one way or the other. I almost wish I wasn’t a writer when I see these types of movies—and I wish I wasn’t a writer with brutally honest agents, because a huge part of my life is deconstructing why something works or doesn’t work. Even if I love something, I’m going to nitpick it to death, because that’s just how I’m programmed now to experience stories and media. And that’s a bit of a shame, and I kind of wonder how 20-years-ago me would have experienced this film differently. But as it stands now, yeah, I did enjoy it, but I can’t help seeing what I consider to be areas for improvement.”

Lara Elena Donnelly on magic:

“Holly Black was one of my Clarion instructors, and when she was talking to us about magic systems in fantasy, she said there are two kinds—there’s day logic and night logic. Day logic is the kind you can explain with rules, like in Harry Potter: If you say these words, and you move your wand like this, you get this effect. And night logic is things that just feel right, and you can’t poke too hard at it. It’s harder to write, because you have to conjure the feeling of rightness, without the explicit rules. And so to me a lot of this movie felt very night logic. You can’t push too hard on this. It’s just something that works because it feels right.”

Stephen Graham Jones, author of My Heart Is a Chainsaw, is a big fan of the final girl trope.

“The final girl is to the slasher as the silver bullet is to the werewolf, as daylight is to the vampire, as a headshot is to the zombie,” Jones says in Episode 482 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “They’re nature’s antidote to this cycle of violence.”

Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley says that final girls tap into our natural tendency to root for the underdog. “It’s more of an accomplishment for a young woman to defeat the bad guy than if it’s some experienced, buff soldier,” he says. “It’s not as much of a challenge for a character like that.”

Grady Hendrix, author of The Final Girl Support Group, says that the defining feature of final girls is tenacity. “They don’t quit trying things, they don’t give up,” he says. “Laurie Strode [in Halloween] isn’t very strong or very fast, Ginny in Friday the 13th Part 2 isn’t particularly powerful. They just keep trying, they just don’t stop.”

Final girls often appear in movies, but until recently the trope was less common in books. Horror author Theresa DeLucci says that a new generation of authors are now exploring the idea of final girls in more depth. “I think the trend in final girl fiction has been less watching them from the outside, and more looking at how they feel, and trauma, and the impact of trauma on their lives, from their own point of view,” she says. “And that’s how it’s making it seem fresh again, especially this summer.”

Stephen Graham Jones on Scream:

“I was in grad school in Florida, and the deal I made with myself to go to grad school was that I could only go if I wrote all the time—I didn’t get to do any socializing or going out or anything. Over winter break in ’96, there came a knock on my door. There’s a friend saying, ‘Hey, let’s go to a movie.’ I gave him the usual excuse. I said, ‘Hey man, I’m writing a story. Sorry.’ And he kept arguing with me, and finally it got to be easier to go to this stupid movie with him than to argue with him. So I went, and it was Scream, and I just felt my brain rewiring itself, like all the homework I’d been doing my whole life was suddenly worth it. And I was there the next six nights, seeing that movie again, and I’ve been living it ever since—reading about it, writing about it, watching it over and over again.”

Theresa DeLucci on women in horror:

“One of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life was going to a horror convention where Ruggero Deodato was the guest of honor, and Goblin was playing. They showed House on the Edge of the Park, Fulci, Cannibal Holocaust, all these things. I was the only woman in an audience of 100, and by the third movie with like the fifth rape scene, I just got up and left. I took my boyfriend’s keys and was just like, ‘I can’t anymore. I can’t.’ I went home and just sat in a dark room and kind of felt nauseous all day. I’m like, ‘These movies are not for me.’ And I do think there is more of a trend now in movies—and we see it in fiction as well—where the sexualization of a female corpse, right off the bat, is not the trend anymore.”

Grady Hendrix on death:

“Death is ultimately the nameless, faceless, masked killer with an unusual weapon—a scythe—coming for all of us. Death is the great equalizer. That’s one of the things I love about slasher movies, like Friday the 13th Part 2. Jason kills you if you’re a badass in a gang, he kills you if you’re a good girl, he kills you if you’re a snob, he kills you if you’re a douchey guy. Watching douchebags, male or female, get it from Jason, watching tough guys in gangs, male or female, who are menacing other people get it from Jason, that never gets old. Death takes everyone down a peg. It doesn’t matter how popped your collar is, or how many motorcycles you ride, or how big your mohawk is, Jason will punch your head off.”

Grady Hendrix on The Final Girl Support Group:

“When I was a kid, and not allowed to see R-rated movies, I would read about them and pretend I’d seen them, because I didn’t want people to know I was a loser who couldn’t see R-rated movies. When I was 8, I managed to trick someone into buying me a copy of Fangoria #12 from April of ’81, which had Friday the 13th Part 2 on the cover. The big twist at the beginning of part two is that Alice Hardy, the final girl from part one, played by Adrienne King, seems to be the star of Part 2, and then gets knocked off 10 minutes in. She’s having this normal night, she’s getting over her trauma from part one, and then Jason just ice picks her in the head. I remember really clearly being blown away by how casually cruel that was. … I think part of it was because I identified with her for some reason, and I didn’t want her to die, because it was like me dying. And that’s really where the book comes from.”

Craddock is the author of more than a dozen books about video games, including Break Out, about the history of Apple II games, and Rocket Jump, about the history of first-person shooters.

“I tend to write a lot about games made in the ’80s, ’90s, and early ’00s,” Craddock says in Episode 481 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “I love to write about creative people who had big ideas but very, very tight restrictions, and I think that from that comes some of the most enduring products—most enduring experiences—ever made.”

One of Craddock’s most recent books is Stay Awhile and Listen: Book II, about the making of Blizzard’s classic action RPG Diablo II. Craddock says this volume was a much bigger undertaking than Stay Awhile and Listen: Book I, about the original Diablo. “There was just so much more to juggle in terms of timeline, in terms of game,” he says. “I think that a good 10 chapters in Stay Awhile and Listen: Book II focus on Diablo II‘s development. The game was just that massive, and things happening within Blizzard and Blizzard North were that important as well. It’s just a much bigger undertaking.”

The creation of Diablo II was an exhausting process that involved a brutal 18-month crunch. Employees were handed sleeping bags and provided regular meals so they never had to leave the office. The experience took a heavy toll on everyone involved. “You miss your home, you miss your bed, you miss your significant other, you miss your friends, you miss your favorite TV shows—actually watching them live with the rest of the world,” Craddock says. “These people sacrificed a lot to make this game.”

Listen to the complete interview with David L. Craddock in Episode 481 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.

David L. Craddock on Diablo II: Lord of Destruction:

“Diablo II launched on June 29th, 2000. One year later, to the day, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction—the one and only official expansion for the game—launched. Diablo II is great, but Lord of Destruction made it even better. Everyone who worked on Lord of Destruction considers it the high point of their time at Blizzard North, because for the year after Diablo II‘s launch, when a lot of other people at the studio—most of the rest of the studio—were drifting, getting very frustrated and very burned out, the Lord of Destruction team was really living every game developer’s dream. You have a successful product, you have a pipeline in place to make more content for that product, you’ve already gone through the labor pains of putting all this stuff in place, now you can just create more stuff.”

David L. Craddock on David Brevik:

“He was one of the people most burned out by Diablo II, because he put so much pressure on himself to succeed. It was kind of controversial, because toward the end he kind of checked out. He was playing a lot of Everquest, and a lot of the other developers, who were still burning the midnight oil, were upset with him. But his marriage was falling apart, he’d put a lot of pressure on himself for both games. He just kind of needed to check out mentally. … He said, ‘I was a ‘seagull manager.’ I would stay home most of the time, and when I’d come in I’d crap all over everything, squawk a lot, and leave.’ And he said that, that’s by his own admission. I have a lot of respect for people who put the truth—the creative truth—ahead of their own ego.”

David L. Craddock on business:

“Blizzard North didn’t want Blizzard Entertainment—the much larger company—coming in and telling them what to do, and so [Blizzard North] shielded their developers from the other Blizzard. On the one hand that’s something that a good manager does: If you’re working on a game and you’re not management, the last thing you want to worry about is, ‘Are we going to get paid?’ or ‘I hear we might be sold.’ You don’t want to worry about that, and the managers don’t want you worrying about that, they want you working. But the downside of that is that if and when those managers leave and a new regime comes in, they don’t know you. You’re just another face in the lineup, and so they have no problem letting you go.”

David L. Craddock on storytelling:

“The Diablo II cinematics were developed at Blizzard Entertainment—they were completely separate from the development of the game itself. … You could play Diablo II without watching any of the cinematics and not miss a beat, because the beauty of Diablo II is that you don’t have to pay attention to the story—you can just kind of click through and pay attention to the loot. Those games are inherently replayable, and each time you play you pay less attention to the story, because it’s just old hat by that point. That was actually one of the problems with Chris Metzen taking such a prominent role on Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo III—the version that eventually came out in 2012. The story really got in the way, and that’s a mistake that Blizzard North never would have made.”

His new novel The Summer Thieves is a picaresque adventure modeled on the work of Jack Vance.

“I like to always challenge myself with new arenas of fiction writing,” Di Filippo says in Episode 480 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “I realized I had never really done a traditional space opera, so that was the mode that I decided to try.”

Di Filippo is fond of classic space opera, but feels that it has a tendency to fall into a rut. “In most space operas, you either have a very retro setup, like the famous Imperial setup of Star Wars, or you have the Star Trek setup, where it’s modern liberalism spread across the stars,” he says. “I understand why people stick to those, because they are kind of iconic, archetypal means of organization. But it seems to me that if you’re going to speculate, you should try to break new ground.”

In The Summer Thieves, Di Filippo imagines a galaxy ruled by the Quinary, a group of organizations that control five vital industries—information technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, real estate, and security. “Quinary is a word that exists, but I’ve repurposed it,” he says. “It’s not quite a government, it’s not quite a series of NGOs, it’s not quite corporations. It’s a body that kind of blends all of those.”

Di Filippo finds the Quinary pretty believable, given the extent to which the modern world seems controlled by just five companies—Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. But he says that readers will have to judge his worldbuilding for themselves. “I have no degrees in poli-sci or economics or any of those wonderful, abstruse disciplines,” he says. “I’m an unrepentant English major, so this is all out of my reading and out of my own head and experience. So we’ll see if people buy it as plausible.”

Listen to the complete interview with Paul Di Filppo in Episode 480 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.

Paul Di Filippo on the Mirrorshades anthology:

“There were 11 or 12 of us in the Mirrorshades anthology, and one fellow, Tom Maddox, has dropped out. He doesn’t write fiction anymore, and we’ve lost contact with him. But I would have intermittent communications with my fellows, as the need arose. But then I said, ‘We never all converse anymore,’ and we had this shared past, and we achieved something. So I put together a CC list, and every once in a while I or someone else will see a relevant article and we’ll just broadcast it to the 10 or 11 of us who are still on the right side of the soil here. … We all still have careers of a sort and are all still writing. John Shirley’s new book Stormland was excellent. Bruce Sterling just had a story collection come out this year. And William Gibson, of course nobody needs to be informed of his achievements. So I think we all hang together just out of sheer wonderment that we survived the last 40 years and are still being productive.”

Paul Di Filippo on “Ribofunk: The Manifesto”:

“I said, ‘Let me do this half serious, half tongue-in-cheek polemical broadsheet, and circulate it, and see what people think.’ So off I went to Kinko’s—after producing this on my dot matrix [printer], and literally cutting and pasting in a couple illustrations—and xeroxed 100 copies and mailed them out to various people. It was reprinted contemporaneously in a few sources, and it seemed to touch the instincts of a few people, because there was a small flourishing of such fiction after that broadside. If you look in Wikipedia under ‘biopunk’—which is the name that’s come to dominate this subgenre of science fiction—I think they have a line that says something like, ‘Paul Di Filippo tried to get everyone to call it “ribofunk,” but nobody did.’ So it was not a 100 percent successful revolution.”

Paul Di Filippo on deplatforming:

“I am not a fan of [deplatforming]. I’m the old school ‘the cure for bad speech is more speech.’ That’s a classic belief that’s informed our country since the beginning. To me, a multiplicity of voices will be the best technique for drowning out the insane or bad or destructive voices. Squelching never works. You try to silence something and you drive it underground, and it becomes stronger by the persecution. So to me, the kind of deplatforming that we experience nowadays is not a good thing. … There’s blowback and there’s fallout from any such interventions, and we really have to use them very sparingly, and with a little more wisdom than we have in the past.”

Paul Di Filippo on the Internet of Things:

“In my story ‘The Dish Ran Away with the Spoon,’ based on the famous nursery rhyme, I looked at the Internet of Things, and how there might be hacking challenges involved with this notion of making a smart refrigerator talk to a smart washing machine, and what might happen in those circumstances. My thinking on this was inspired by the great Robert Sheckley, a name that’s not on the tip of everyone’s tongue these days, but Sheckley was a major, major writer in the ’50s and ’60s. … His fiction always included a lot of devices that had gotten too smart for their own good—much in the manner of Philip K. Dick, where the robotic taxicab is arguing with you about where you want to go. So you can see it’s that kind of lineage of ideas that just persists. Here I am, 50 years after these guys, still trying to make sense of these ideas.”

Historian Richard Carrier says that the novel presents a fairly accurate portrait of first-century Judea.

“[Moorcock] is not trying to describe every detail of life, he’s not trying to create color—which is where all the mistakes could arise,” Carrier says in Episode 479 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “He’s describing scenes so simply, his narrative is so minimalist in the way it’s constructed, that he escapes a lot of those problems. So it becomes a plausible story in context, because there aren’t a lot of places he butts up against history and makes a mistake.”

In Behold the Man, Karl is able to locate Jesus fairly quickly. But Carrier thinks that in reality, finding Jesus would be a real challenge, since all the information we have about him comes from highly unreliable sources. He says that finding any particular person in ancient Jerusalem, a city of more than 70,000 people, could take a lot of time and effort.

“I’d want to sit around and wait until someone’s talking about this particular prophet,” he says. “I would try to have inroads to all the local sects and see what’s brewing, and try to figure that out. And I would use it as double duty as a historian to just document all kinds of cool stuff that’s unrelated to Jesus while I’m there, and then maybe leave it in a time capsule—bury it in a pot so it could be like a new Nag Hammadi discovery, all my time traveler books about the era.”

In general Carrier thinks that science fiction authors tend to underestimate the difficulties a time traveler would face surviving in the past. “It would take you a while to get settled,” he says. “You’d have to figure out the customs, the language, how to get money so you could eat. There are a lot of things you’d need to sort out, because it’s basically an adventure mission. You’re basically going into the Congo with whatever’s on your back, and then you need to get your base of operations and figure stuff out, and then you can relax and wait for whatever scene or event you’re trying to watch.”

One of the biggest threats would be viruses, an issue that’s seldom tackled in science fiction. “The problem with time travel is that if you went back in time, you would probably wipe out the whole population then, and they would probably kill you within months with viruses that you have no immunity to,” Carrier says. “So note to time travel authors: You have to come up with a universal immunity so that the time traveler who goes back is not bringing viruses that everybody is not immune to, and is immune to viruses that his body has never encountered.”

Listen to the complete interview with Richard Carrier in Episode 479 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.

Richard Carrier on time travel:

“If I had to go into the past, and it had to be the Roman Empire, I would probably pick right after the victory of Vespasian, because from everything I’ve read, Vespasian seems a very pragmatic fellow. I feel like I could go there and convince him to institute a proper constitutional government, in exchange for certain technologies of empire, like the railroad, for instance, and the printing press. Possibly gunpowder. That wouldn’t fix every problem—it would turn the Roman Empire into the British Empire, basically, which is a slight improvement, but still pretty far back—but if we could get that constitutional government set in, we could have social progress as well as scientific and technological progress a thousand years earlier, and we could bypass the hell of the Middle Ages.”

Richard Carrier on the Babylonian Talmud:

“We have the complete Babylonian Talmud, and it does mention Jesus and Christians, but weirdly it always places the story of Jesus’ execution a hundred years earlier. It puts it right after the death of Alexander Jannaeus, in some sort of Hellenized Jewish context. [Jesus] is stoned by the Jewish authorities—there are no Romans, because Romans aren’t there yet—he’s stoned by Jewish authorities in Joppa rather than outside Jerusalem. So there’s this whole different narrative. He’s placed in a completely different century. And it’s definitely the same guy—Jesus of Nazareth, mother was Mary, the whole thing. … It’s usually just dismissed as some sort of change or error or whatever, but it’s actually hard to explain if there was an actual historical Jesus.”

Richard Carrier on his book Jesus from Outer Space:

“The first Christians were preaching that Jesus was a space alien, he was like Klaatu from The Day the Earth Stood Still. That was their view. You really don’t understand the origins of Christianity if you don’t understand this. There’s a lot of pushback against it, because of the anachronistic belief that he didn’t come from ‘outer space,’ he came from ‘heaven.’ But back then that was outer space. The idea that heaven was another dimension—that you can’t get to it in this universe, it’s somewhere else—that idea is modern. That did not exist back then. Back then, heaven was literally up there. You could point to it. If you had a telescope you could watch it, if you had a rocket you could go to it. That was what heaven was.”

Richard Carrier on hallucinations:

“These [early Christian] sects, especially these fringe sects, were very obsessed with having visions, so they were looking for ways to do it. A lot of them might have attracted schizotypal persons, who are persons who don’t have schizophrenia, but are highly prone to hallucinate. … We have a very hallucination-hostile culture now, where a hallucination is immediately medicalized as a mental disorder, it’s not respected as real, and so on. This is a radically different culture that we live in now from what was going on back then. In that culture, hallucinations were respected as real visions, and you could actually move up in the ranks of a religious movement the more—and more fascinatingly—you hallucinated encounters with the divine.”

Overall the cost of family days out has risen by a third, according to the Play Like Mum website, which compared the cost of visiting popular sites five years ago with today’s prices.

In the summer of 2016, it cost £16.60 for a family to visit Carlisle’s medieval castle compared with £32.80 now. Another English Heritage site, Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, recorded a similarly steep increase , with a family ticket rising from £22.60 to £40.80.

However, these destinations both look good value when compared with some of the others surveyed by the website. A family planning to visit Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and HMS Victory now have to find the kind of sum that would have made Nelson avert his gaze – £120. In 2016, a family ticket cost £68.

The research found that it now costs 43% more to visit the Tower of London – up to £82. There has been an increase in the cost of admiring Bath’s Roman baths that would have made even Caesar blush – a 75% increase since 2016, to £76.

Andrew Coplestone, Play Like Mum’s founder, says: “Some of these huge increases mean that some families may not be able to afford local days out with their children, especially as a single parent.”

A spokesperson for English Heritage says many of its sites have been transformed over the last five years, with extra value added.

“At places like Tintagel Castle in Cornwall there has been the installation of a dramatic footbridge, a revamped exhibition and outdoor interpretation – at less than £9 a person for a family ticket, it offers good value and is competitively priced with other major attractions.”"

Almost five years later a new world order has emerged, but it is not the one China’s president and others gathered in Davos that day seemed to have in mind.

Instead of a continuation of the post-cold war era of growth underpinned by free trade, the world faces a fractured economic system where the post-pandemic supply shock and mistrust bred by the virus pushes countries towards an autarkist impulse for self-sufficiency.

Autarky is a Greek word meaning “self-reliance” and was popularised as shorthand for economic nationalism in the 19th century. It gained some credence as an economic model when the young Soviet Union in effect shut itself off from world trade, and the nationalist impulse towards self-sufficiency appealed to Hitler. It also flourished in the postwar world, especially in Africa, though the creed of globalisation has left few examples outside North Korea.

There were already some signs of nationalist-driven challenges to the prevailing system exemplified by Brexit, the rise of Trump, and a growing suspicion that China was not prepared to play by the rules set by the US and its proxies.

The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated these trends, experts believe.

Evgeny Postnikov, a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Melbourne, says the pressures of the pandemic have delivered a stark realisation about how much countries rely on imports and products enmeshed in the global supply chain.

From the initial scramble to protect production of face masks in France, to the careful control of vaccine technology, the pandemic has thrown up countless examples of how quickly the existing world order began to buckle under the domino effect of nationalistic urges.

“Governments can’t be relying on strategic competitors to supply crucial goods and services,” Postnikov says. “Trade and security were seen differently but now both are treated as high politics. That is why autarkist push is not going away. If anything it will get stronger, and that is quite worrying.”

The power cuts across northern China in recent weeks have led Beijing to accelerate its drive to become more self-sufficient. After hopeful signs that China would wean itself off fossil fuels by shutting hundreds of coal-fired power stations, the hint this week from Beijing of a rethink on slashing emissions is a crushing blow to global cooperation on the climate crisis.

Under the “Made in China” policy launched in 2018, China is already trying to develop more capacity in semiconductors, the lifeblood of consumer goods ranging from Teslas to toasters, and PlayStations to printers, as well as other strategic products. The country’s belt and road initiative is binding dozens of nations in Asia, Africa and Europe into Beijing’s economic orbit.

India, which was slow to begin dumping its corporatist economic model in favour of a more global-facing one, has also given a name for its plan to head back in the opposite direction: Atmanirbhar Bharat. This translates as “self-reliant India” and is designed, in the words of the foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, to extricate the country from “global commitments not to our advantage”.

Hence India’s withdrawal last year from the pan-Asian Regional Comprehensive Economic Cooperation pact (Rcep) over concerns that its huge agricultural sector would be sacrificed on the altar of free trade.

In Britain the sudden loss of cheap migrant labour means employers are looking again at their business models. On Wednesday Britain’s “chicken king”, the head of the country’s largest poultry producer, called for a total rethink of how food is produced. “Three months ago I was vocal about the government needing to help with labour issues,” said Ranjit Singh Boparan, the owner of 2 Sisters Food Group, which processes 10 million chickens a week. “I’ve now come to the conclusion that in reality it can’t fix all the problems.”

He says he no longer believes the solution is more visas for foreign workers: instead, the price of food will have to rise in line with the cost of producing it.

“We need to work with our supply chains and customers to solve these issues. But it will come at a cost. I need to invest, increase automation and make our factories more welcoming for new recruits,” he said.

The supply shock has “thrown sand in the gears of the world economy”, according to George Magnus, an independent economist and associate at the China Centre, at Oxford University. “It is hard to disentangle structural issues around the supply chain with the process of globalisation. Everything is more complicated and more expensive. It looks like a symptom of a decomposing global economy.”

He says the world economy should begin to realign by next year but that the current crisis could have a “corrosive impact in the medium term” as companies seek to diversify from sole-source supply and secure strategically important products such as semiconductors, batteries and energy.

More than 80% of industries have experienced supply chain disruptions because of the pandemic, according to a report by the consultancy Deloitte, and about 75% of companies have brought forward plans to repatriate manufacturing from overseas by building smart factories closer to home.

A study by the Reshoring Initiative, in the US, has forecast that the country will add 224,213 jobs from abroad in 2021, an increase of 38% on 2020. Investment in strategic products such as semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries and pharmaceuticals are driving the changes, the report says.

There are similar moves in the UK, where a report predicts factories could make almost £5bn more goods in 2021 as the pandemic and Brexit prompt businesses to bring home production.

The rising cost of labour in countries such as China have added pressure on corporations for a rethink of the way their products are made. For example, labour costs are now cheaper in Mexico than in China and short-circuiting the economic model of the latter as the workshop of the world while providing a powerful incentive for American producers to set up shop closer to home.

Another problem undermining the global system is that the controversy over the origins of coronavirus has poisoned relations already struggling with battles over tariffs, Hong Kong, and alleged Chinese infiltration of foreign communications networks through the state champion Huawei.

“The virus has bred mistrust,” says Magnus, “and the division sown by this has been a shock for China. It’s not going to be easy to make good because public attitudes in the west now show a high level of antagonism towards China. I don’t know what it would take to come back from that.”

Britain’s withdrawal from the EU was a shock to the world’s trading system, and when Trump took power days after that Xi speech at Davos one of his first acts was to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. It could be a sign of things to come as countries “decouple” from the globalised system.

“We’re not going to end up with lots of North Koreas – the autarkist state par excellence,” says Postnikov. “But what we will see I think is a world of smaller regional blocs where there are shorter supply chains. The TPP, Rcep, Brexit – it’s all unilateralist, whereas before these problems were viewed through a multilateral lens.”"

Rishi Sunak is set to confirm that the “pause” on public sector pay that affected 2.6 million teachers, police and civil servants will be lifted in April, as the economy bounces back from Covid.

The chancellor imposed the freeze last November and it came into force in April. At the time, he said it was unfair for public sector workers to get a rise while many of their private sector counterparts were being furloughed or losing their jobs.

With wages in many sectors rising, and the prime minister using his party conference speech to highlight the prospects for a “high-wage economy”, Treasury sources said that argument no longer applied.



However, each Whitehall department will have to fund any pay increases from within its own budget, and TUC analysis shows that the pay of many public sector workers has fallen significantly in real terms after years of tight settlements.

Sunak will set out the funding for each individual department as part of a three-year spending review, which he will deliver alongside the budget on 27 October.

Here’s the full story:"
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/15/tory-austerity-deaths-cut-human-cost-cruel-policy,"['2010', 'health', 'care', 'nhs', 'cuts', 'spending', 'worse', 'day', 'million', 'tory', 'social', 'toynbee', 'deaths', 'austerity', 'misery', 'polly', 'caused']","Deaths are what can be counted most easily – bodies can’t be hidden from the statisticians or denied by those responsible for the figures. It was predictable, and predicted, that many more would die when the government of David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg applied a brutal tourniquet to public spending in 2010. Warnings at the time were shrugged off as shroud-waving and scaremongering.

But new research from University of York’s renowned Centre For Health Economics only confirms the inevitable consequence: an extra 57,550 people in England died in the five years from 2010, a level of deaths beyond the statistically normal. Life expectancy improvement slowed, which was directly “attributable to spending constraints in the healthcare and social care sectors”, according to lead researcher Prof Karl Claxton.

But below the radar, below the level of all these countable death certificates, consider the suffering imposed on millions by withdrawing care, support and income. Austerity didn’t just cut lives short: it scarred people, especially many children and young people brought up in extreme poverty. This effect is well researched and thoroughly proven.

By 2010, the Labour government had lifted a million children and a million pensioners out of poverty. I once chronicled Labour’s social programmes and their effects from 1997 to 2010. Spending on the NHS rose by an average of 7% a year, more than since it was founded in 1948. Waiting lists, which had been the NHS rationing system, fluctuating with spending, were reduced to near zero by 2010 for the first time. Though social care was never resolved, local authorities had more money to cover its rising costs. After 2010, the NHS suffered the leanest years in its history. Delaying operations adds to risk – and the great rise in the waiting lists to more than 4 million people in England happened well before the pandemic.

Cut care, and people suffer: Age UK says that compared with before 2010, 1.4 million fewer frail people are getting any help at all, as the eligibility criteria tighten year after year. Many more were bound to die. In March 2019 I spent the day at an old people’s day centre in Hastings. This was the day before it closed, becoming the seventh such centre to do so in the town; more have gone since. It was absolutely clear to the devoted staff that many of those frail old people would suffer and probably die sooner, without daily hot meals and supervised medicines – but, above all, without company and friendship. Some had been friends for years but now they were losing their day centre and the minibus to bring them together; they were to be left home alone, some with no care. Are their names among these excess deaths?

That story is in the book I co-wrote with David Walker, The Lost Decade, 2010-2020, in which we detailed the losses deliberately inflicted by government cuts. Consider the stark cruelties imposed by the deepest benefit cuts. Look at the bedroom tax, trying to force people out of family homes if they had a spare room. One of the first cases we recorded was that of a family whose 10-year-old child had died recently. The benefit cap and the two-child benefit limit has had the most severe effect on families with three or more children, many of whom never expected to rely on benefits but suffered some of life’s unexpected disasters – which is what social security is supposed to defend against.

Separate research published in the Lancet today from Imperial College shows that life expectancy has fallen since 2010 in the poorest places in Blackpool, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle. That is what cuts do. Look at the loss of services for mental health, homelessness and addiction. These pick up life’s fallers, rescuing them before it’s too late. Did anyone think deaths wouldn’t follow?

Then there was the abrupt closure of most of Labour’s 3,500 Sure Start children’s centres – the greatest social vandalism of the decade. Here, right from the birth of a child, families could be helped early. Here were centres of support with midwives, health visitors and mental health teams – every service within pram-pushing distance. It was a network of help, a haven for victims of domestic abuse, an early warning for any delayed development in a child. Not only has most of that gone, but health visitors have been cut right back. There is fewer than one school nurse for every 10 schools in England, yet these are vital support for children seeking help. Schools have lost staff, their funding per pupil now below 2010 levels.

Next week the chancellor stands up to announce his budget and three-year spending review. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns us to expect another turn of the screw – a new era of austerity – with cuts in everything but the NHS and schools. This is likely to be as socially and economically damaging as George Osborne’s disastrous policies. No doubt a smattering of small sums will seek to disguise the axe that is about to fall, yet again, on the most vulnerable. Local councils will be hit hard again, along with prisons, courts, further education and everything needed to reach the net-zero climate target. Forget “levelling up”: just to get back to 2010 levels would take very heavy lifting after such devastation to successful social programmes.

Taxes are higher than since the second world war, and yet the UK still remains lower taxed than equivalent EU countries. There are always choices to be made in taxing and spending, but in the last decade Britain has chosen the most damaging path, with austerity harming the economy as well as the social fabric. That looks set to be repeated, no lessons learned – and more excess deaths are entirely predictable."
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/15/climate-crisis-biden-administration-us-economy-report,"['poses', 'climate', 'administration', 'report', 'warns', 'crisis', 'white', 'risk', 'wildfires', 'biden', 'change', 'risks', 'serious', 'economy']","Joe Biden’s administration on Friday issued a 40-page report warning that the climate crisis “poses serious and systemic risks to the US economy and financial system” and setting out steps for action as “climate impacts are already affecting American jobs, homes, families’ hard-earned savings, and businesses”.

Under the new plan, the federal government will weigh up climate risks for employee benefit and retirement plan investments, incorporate climate disasters into lending and budgeting decisions and revise building standards for homes at risk of flooding. Government-backed mortgages for public housing will factor in the risk of calamitous floods, wildfires and other climate impacts.

“The intensifying impacts of climate change present physical risk to assets, publicly traded securities, private investments, and companies,” the US president said in the report. The climate crisis “threatens the competitiveness of US companies and markets, the life savings and pensions of US workers and families, and the ability of US financial institutions to serve communities”, he added.

Gina McCarthy, Biden’s top climate advisor, said that the climate crisis “poses a risk to our economy and to the lives and livelihoods of Americans, and we must act now”. McCarthy added: “This roadmap isn’t just about protecting our financial system – it’s about protecting people, their paychecks and their prosperity.”

The new White House plan has been welcomed by environmental groups eager for the administration to weave climate considerations throughout its decision-making. Under Donald Trump, the US ditched many of these policies, declining to factor in climate change when making decisions over the building of new infrastructure, for example.

“Never before in the history of our country has a US president taken such a sweeping view on climate change,” said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of Ceres. “The Biden administration is showing the importance of addressing climate risks and opportunities across all government agencies.”

The White House report was issued as the crucial Cop26 global climate talks are due to begin in Scotland at the end of the month, with world leaders attending and intending to spell out their plans to help the planet avoid catastrophic heating and the climate destabilization that is already under way.

Prominent figures from Britain’s Queen Elizabeth to Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg have in recent days expressed, in their very different ways, exasperation with leaders favoring talk over action on the climate emergency.

Many are looking for the US to lead the way. Trump was infamously skeptical about the climate crisis and was exuberant about pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord, agreed at the groundbreaking UN global summit on climate in France in 2015.

Biden immediately returned the US to the agreement upon taking the presidency, when he beat Trump in November 2020.

The White House report on Friday was a follow-up to a May executive order from Biden that essentially called on his own administration to analyze how the world’s largest economy could be affected by extreme heat, flooding, storms, wildfires and the broader adjustments needed to address climate change.

Friday’s report stated: “The scientific evidence on climate change has grown increasingly stark. Continued warming will further destabilize our climate and produce more frequent and intense storms, wildfires, and heatwaves as well as more damaging droughts and more extensive ecosystem losses.”

It also noted: “In August 2021, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report in which 234 of the world’s leading scientists, citing over 14,000 different studies, concluded with high confidence that the climate crisis is a ‘code red for humanity’.”

Global temperatures are already up 1C since industrialization. Keeping them from rising more than 1.5C and avoiding environmental catastrophe would require unprecedented action to begin phasing out fossil fuels within the next 12 years, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

“If this year has shown us anything, it’s that climate change poses an ongoing urgent and systemic risk to our economy and to the lives and livelihoods of everyday Americans, and we must act now,” Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate adviser, said.

A February storm in Texas led to widespread power outages, 210 deaths and severe property damage. Wildfires raged in western states. The heat dome in the Pacific north-west caused record temperatures in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Hurricane Ida struck Louisiana in August and caused deadly flooding in the north-east.

The actions recommended by the Biden administration reflect a significant shift in the broader discussion about climate change, suggesting that the nation must prepare for the costs that families, investors and governments will bear.

Among the steps outlined is the government’s Financial Stability Oversight Council developing the tools to identify and lessen climate-related risks to the economy. The treasury department plans to address the risks to the insurance sector and availability of coverage. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at mandatory disclosure rules about the opportunities and risks generated by the climate emergency.

The labor department on Wednesday proposed a rule for investment managers to factor environmental decisions into the choices made for pensions and retirement savings.

The Office of Management and Budget announced the government will begin the process of asking federal agencies to consider greenhouse gas emissions from the companies providing supplies. Biden’s budget proposal for fiscal 2023 will feature an assessment of climate risks.

Federal agencies involved in lending and mortgages for homes are looking for the impact on the housing market, with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and its partners developing disclosures for homebuyers on flood and climate-related risks. The Department of Veterans Affairs will also look at climate risks for its home lending program.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency is updating the standards for its National Flood Insurance Program, potentially revising guidelines that go back to 1976.

“We now do recognize that climate change is a systemic risk,” McCarthy said. “We have to look fundamentally at the way the federal government does its job and how we look at the finance system and its stability.”"

However, each Whitehall department will have to fund any pay increases from within its own budget, and TUC analysis shows that the pay of many public sector workers has fallen significantly in real terms after years of tight settlements.

The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “In the face of a looming cost-of-living crisis, the government must increase departmental budgets so that every public sector worker gets a meaningful, real-terms pay increase. If ministers don’t give departments the funding to raise pay, they are not ending the public sector pay freeze.”

Recent polling carried out for the TUC by YouGov found 27% of public sector workers said the government’s pay policy had made them more likely to quit.

NHS staff and public servants earning less than £24,000 were exempted from the pay freeze, but it covered 2.6 million other public sector workers, including teachers, firefighters, the armed forces and police.

Sunak will set out the funding for each individual department as part of a three-year spending review, which he will deliver alongside the budget on 27 October.

The defence minister Tobias Ellwood has already said he hopes the armed forces will be given a pay increase of “more than 1%” from April. Local government workers have been offered 1.75%, well below the rate of inflation, which has been rejected by unions.

A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the incredible work that public sector workers have continued to do throughout the pandemic, and the challenges many of them have faced as key workers.”

Sunak is also expected to announce April’s increase in the “national living wage” (NLW), after the low pay commission has produced its final report in the coming days. The commission advises the government on how to reach the target set by George Osborne of lifting the NLW to two-thirds of median earnings by 2024.

In March, it suggested £9.42 as the rate likely to be necessary, based on wage forecasts at the time – but since then pay has been growing robustly, and some experts believe a higher figure is likely. The current rate is £8.91.

Johnson seized on the promise of a higher wage post-Brexit economy earlier this month as petrol shortages afflicted forecourts and businesses in sectors including hospitality and retail complained of difficulties recruiting staff.

However, Sunak has made clear he is concerned about the risk of inflation getting out of control if wages rise without improvements in productivity – from better skills and investment in new technologies, for example.

“That is something that we’ve discussed in this country together and have collectively decided that’s not the right model going forward,” he told reporters during International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings in Washington this week.

“We want to move to a higher-wage, higher-skilled economy. Now obviously that will take time, and we would want to make sure that is accompanied by increases in productivity, so it’s not inflationary.”

A Treasury source said Sunak was concerned about the risks of rising inflation, which could lead the Bank of England to increase interest rates and potentially push up the cost of servicing the government’s debt. “It’s something that he has had his eye on for a long time now,” the source said.

UK inflation measured on the consumer prices index was 3% in August, up from 1% in March."

In a message that will be seen as a swipe at more hawkish members of the monetary policy committee (MPC), who have signalled a willingness to raise borrowing costs, the economists said the recovery still remained uncertain.

Catherine Mann, a former chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the US bank Citi, said the central bank could hold off on raising interest rates because financial market traders were doing some of its work for it by betting on tighter monetary policy in Britain and the US.

She said speculation about the BoE’s intentions was increasing the cost of borrowing in financial markets, which is what a rate rise would be designed to achieve.

“They see that monetary policy normalisation is the direction of travel … and so they are doing their homework and they are starting to price in that direction of travel,” Mann told an online discussion organised by the Euro50 Group, which debates European economic and financial policy issues.

Silvana Tenreyro, who sits on the MPC with Mann, also spoke out against an early rate hike, saying a nudge higher could be “self-defeating” if inflationary pressures turn out to be temporary.

On a virtual trip to Wales, Tenreyro argued that the current level of inflation was being measured against low prices last year in the aftermath of the first lockdown.

The former London School of Economics professor said large increases in the global price of energy and other commodities were also pushing up inflation, “but these effects in general tend to be short-lived”.

Speaking to BusinessLive Wales, Tenreyro said: “The prices go up, but they don’t keep going up sustainably, so you have a one-off price effect and in that sense inflation should be transitory.

“By the time interest rates were having a major effect on inflation, the effects of energy prices would already be dropping out of the inflation calculation. If some effects were to prove more persistent, it would be important to balance the risks from a period of above target inflation with the cost of weaker demand,” she added.

Many investors are betting that the BoE will raise interest rates before the end of the year, becoming the first major central bank to do so since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Last week the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, said he was concerned about inflation running above the central bank’s 2% target and the “very damaging” effect if consumers and businesses believed it had become permanently elevated.

Another MPC member, Michael Saunders, said it was appropriate that financial markets were focused on a rate rise before Christmas, adding to speculation that Threadneedle Street might raise rates.

Bank officials are concerned that a long period of above-target inflation could trigger a round of pay rises that force companies to put up prices of goods and services further."

Toys on display at Hamley’s toy store in London, Britain, today Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA

Back in the UK, Hamleys has said there will be plenty of toys to buy in its stores this Christmas, as it unveiled its top toy predictions for 2021 – a list that includes a “magic” cauldron and the latest in Lego’s tie-up with Super Mario.

Victoria Kay, the head of buying at the toy chain, said the retailer had been building up its stock levels since March.

“I don’t have a crystal ball but all I can say it that as we stand today we’re in a really strong position.”

The possibility of a toy shortage this Christmas have become the latest concerns in the country’s supply chain crisis. This week a buildup of cargo in Felixstowe resulted in vessels being directed to other ports, leading to predictions that toy deliveries would be waylaid. The Entertainer toy chain has predicted there will not be enoughBarbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys to meet demand.



Hamleys, which is famous for its flagship store on Regent Street, London, said it had plenty of the toys in a top 10 that runs the gamut from £11 for a LOL Surprise Doll to the Barbie Dream House, which with a working lift and swimming pool costs £310.

However, it described the Magic Mixies Cauldron as the “wow toy of 2021”. The set, which costs £70, comes with a wand, spell book, potions and interactive toy. Young magicians can use it to conjure, complete with smoky special effects, a cuddly pet critter. The refills needed to repeat the theatrics cost about £10....

Having ruled out renegotiation of the protocol in July, the EU is proposing a “bespoke Northern Ireland-specific solution”.

Sausages

A new certificate scheme would mean that certain products that are generally prohibited for import into the EU, such as British sausages, would now be allowed to be imported. The EU would retain the right, however, to impose a ban if there is any suggestion these products are entering the wider single market.

Plants, meat and dairy

Checks would be reduced by 80% on a large range of supermarket product lines, through reinforced monitoring of supply chains and the use of specific packaging and labelling indicating that the goods are for sale only in the UK. In return the EU wants the UK to deliver on its commitment to complete the construction of permanent border control posts at Northern Irish ports for incoming trade from Great Britain.

Haulage

A type of haulage known as groupage, where goods from different companies for different customers are grouped together on one lorry, has experienced significant disruption. In groupage haulage, a truck can pick up goods from several warehouses with loads moving from one lorry to another. Each time, the seals have to be broken and goods recertified in a complex, time-consuming and error-prone process. The EU has proposed that such trucks transporting different food products, such as dairy, meat, fish, confectionary, fruit and vegetables, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would just need one certificate stating that all goods of different types, class or description meet the requirements of EU legislation.

Customs

The EU is proposing to cut customs paperwork by half. The scope of an existing scheme waiving customs controls on “goods not at risk” of entering the single market would be expanded to more small and medium-sized enterprises. A car dealer ordering car parts would only need to provide basic information such as the invoice value of the parts and the parties to the transaction for customs clearance purposes. But the EU would demand in return a commitment from the UK to provide full and real-time access to IT systems.

Medicines

In response to threats to affordability and availability of generic medicines in Northern Ireland, the EU would waive a requirement that medical manufacturers move out of Great Britain into Northern Ireland. Companies supplying the Northern Irish market could continue to have their supply “hub” in Great Britain, a privilege not usually afforded to countries outside the EU single market.

Governance

There is no suggestion that the European court of justice will lose its role as the arbiter of EU law in Northern Ireland. But following criticism that the protocol is “undemocratic”, the Northern Ireland assembly, civil society groups and businesses would be invited to take part in “structured dialogues” with the European Commission on implementing the hundreds of EU laws that apply in the region, although they would not have any decision-making power."

Coming from a privileged background he yet had a determined independence of mind and an egalitarian outlook.

The son of Sir George Gater, a civil servant, and Irene (nee Nichols), who ran the National Gallery canteen for Myra Hess’s wartime concerts, he was named Anthony George Richard, and known as Anthony by his family but as George by his friends from boyhood on. Born in London, he was educated at Winchester college and then studied philosophy, politics and economics at New College, Oxford, following national service.

At the National Economic Development Office (Nedo), from 1969 to 1986, George headed the group working for the textiles and garment industries, which were facing relentless competition from overseas. Nedo was set up in 1962 by the Conservative government to look at the economy through the eyes of industry. Organised as a network of tripartite committees (management, unions and government), it went beyond its original quasi-planning remit to do innovative work.

George’s group of committees spanned the whole industry from spinners and dyers, textile manufacturers, garment and footwear makers, to retailers. Maker/user collaborations happened in his work and in other Nedo sectors before “supply chain” became common parlance. He enthusiastically promoted Better Made in Britain, a 1980s campaign to match buyers to British suppliers.

Nedo for George was not a thinktank, it was an agent for persuasion. Nedo’s unique structure and network enabled questions such as why some firms prospered and others did not to be examined in depth, and best practice demonstrated.

He tackled everything with persistence, a zeal for high standards and no inhibitions. He enjoyed badgering those senior to him. Defining and measuring Nedo’s own success was a constant preoccupation – he sent the director general a postcard from holiday to remind him he needed to address it. Very recently he was pursuing erstwhile colleagues, garnering them to lobby current policy makers on industrial strategy and point them to Nedo’s work.

An art lover all his life he took to acquiring pictures that defied identification. He haunted the V&A and the Witt Library and took his finds to museums and academics, always getting a hearing. The collection of paintings, some beautiful, some odd, all interesting, gave us a huge amount of pleasure. One picture in particular is the subject of a website he created in 2016, Old Master Detective.

He was a founding trustee of Fine Cell Work, the charity that teaches needlework to prisoners to aid their rehabilitation. Getting it off the ground against resistance from many quarters took heroic effort. George contributed vision and dogged determination, and the organisation flourishes today. Back in 1966 he had similarly given his all when Fritz Schumacher took him on at Intermediate Technology Development Group to produce its first publication, Tools for Progress. ITDG is also alive and well as Practical Action.

George and I first met at Nedo and married in 1985. He was a fond father who loved games, stories, music and dancing, and encouraged our two children, Rosalind and Francis, to find their own paths. George is survived by them, his four grandchildren, Alfred, Rory, Ottoline and Florence, and me."

Kristalina Georgieva, the current IMF boss, is one of the former. The question of whether she instructed for a report to be doctored to put China in a more flattering light when she was vice-president of the World Bank has turned into a saga involving whistleblowers, an external report, lengthy grillings by the IMF board and accusations of a dirty tricks operation mounted by conservative forces in Washington.

As a former European Commission vice-president, Georgieva knows how to look after herself. She has received the backing of the IMF board and comfortably batted away questions about her conduct when questioned by journalists at the IMF’s annual meeting. She will expect memories to be as short as they were when her immediate predecessor, Christine Lagarde, was hauled through the French courts five years ago. In all likelihood, she will be proved right.

That said, it is a bit of a pyrrhic victory for Georgieva and the institution she leads. Public trust in the IMF will be diminished. Reputational damage will be permanent even if it is modest.

The row has forced the World Bank to suspend publication of its Doing Business report, which is no great loss given its bias in favour of deregulation, making social protection less generous and removing minimum wage protection for workers.

It has also prompted calls for an end to the “gentleman’s agreement” whereby the US chooses the president of the World Bank while a European gets to run the IMF. This arrangement, which has existed since the two organisations were created at the end of the second world war, is an anachronism and anything that hastens its end is welcome. Had the selection process been open and based strictly on merit, neither Georgieva nor David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, would be doing their current jobs.

Early rate rise looks increasingly unlikely

Recent City speculation that the Bank of England may raise interest rates before the year’s end looks wildly premature in the light of the recent performance of the economy.

The picture is clear. Activity rebounded fast in the spring as lockdown restrictions eased, but the pace of recovery has since slowed. In August, according to the Office for National Statistics, output rose by a modest 0.4%, while the previously reported 0.1% rise in July was revised down to a 0.1% fall.

Put in context, that was the first monthly drop in gross domestic product since the start of the pandemic, outside a lockdown period. The “pingdemic”, which forced about 1 million people to stay at home, was largely to blame.

When it last produced forecasts for the economy two months ago, the Bank said it was expecting growth of 2.1% in the third quarter of this year, but it would now take an increase in national output of 2.2% in September for that to happen.

That looks out of the question given the bottlenecks in the supply chain that affected the economy last month and the damage caused to consumer and business confidence from rising energy prices. Trade, with imports rising in the latest three months while exports have been falling, will be a drag on growth.

As the gridlock at Felixstowe shows, a lack of HGV drivers will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter – a period when the economy will have to do without the support provided by the government’s furlough scheme and higher universal credit payments.

In short, the GDP numbers act as a useful corrective to unemployment figures released earlier this week showing record job vacancies and payrolls back to pre-crisis levels. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, talked recently of the “hard yards” to come for the economy. The Bank needs to ensure it doesn’t make them even harder."

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product rose by 0.4% in August compared with the previous month as consumers increased their spending on leisure during the first full month without domestic government restrictions in England.

However, the ONS cut its growth estimate for July from a monthly rise of 0.1% to a fall of the same amount after fresh economic data revealed a worse hit for car manufacturing caused by global supply chain problems and shortages in computer chips, also known as semiconductors.

Reflecting a boom for holidaying in the UK while international travel restrictions largely remained in place, the latest snapshot showed activity in accommodation and food services, as well as the arts, entertainment and recreation, contributed the most to growth in the service sector of the economy.

The accommodation sector grew by 23% on the month, driven by spending at hotels and campsites during the key month of the school holidays for holiday destinations across the country.

Although air transport continued to expand as restrictions on foreign travel were gradually lifted – taking off by 27.5% in August – the figures showed activity remained 75% below pre-Covid levels.

Kevin Brown of the investment manager Scottish Friendly said the GDP figures were positive on face value but served as a reminder of the pressures bearing down on the British economy during a burgeoning cost of living crisis.

“In August, people were still enjoying the fruits of the end of lockdown, as the strong growth for services, holidays and dining out in the data suggests. Fast forward two months and that expansion has turned into a squeeze as cost pressures and overwhelming demand catch up,” he said.

Growth in August was offset by a decline in the health sector amid a drop in testing and vaccinations for Covid-19. Retail sales fell, reflecting shortages on the high street and consumers switching more of their spending from goods to services after the easing of pandemic controls.

Against a backdrop of pressure on international supply chains, production output – which includes manufacturing, energy and mining – grew by 0.8% whilecrude petroleum and natural gas output increa after recent temporary maintenance closures at an oilfield.

Challenges from soaring prices and shortages of materials including steel, concrete, timber and glass dragged down the construction sector, with output falling by 0.2% in August after a 1% drop in July.

Overall, the ONS said the economy remained 0.8% below its pre-pandemic level in August.

In a sign of continuing pressure on the economy, separate figures showed severe shortages of lorry drivers and supply chain disruption weighed heavily on UK trade volumes in August.

The ONS said goods exports fell by £1.3bn, or 4.6%, from a month earlier, and were driven by a sharp decline in shipments of cars and mechanical power generators to the EU and the rest of the world.

Paul Craig, a portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said supply problems would no doubt weaken growth expectations for the months ahead as disruption caused by the coronavirus and Brexit dragged on the economy.

“The creaking UK economy is taking its time to spring back to life. The problems lie now not with demand but with supply. Acute labour shortages in several pockets of the economy along with chronic skills shortages have the potential to frustrate the economic recovery, and could well dampen any expectations for a strong economic revival over the winter months,” he said."

But more recently the clouds have started gathering again: prices for certain goods (such as petrol and gas) are going up and, in some cases, goods have even disappeared from shelves. Why is this happening?

At the heart of this current increase in prices are global factors – most importantly the “supply chain squeeze”, the “global energy squeeze” and the “Covid bounce”. All three are hitting many countries at the same time and are testament to just how connected our world economy is.

The most important factor putting pressure on prices is the global energy squeeze; we are seeing increasing prices for gas, petrol and coal. Global demand for fossil fuels is rebounding strongly as the pandemic eases – and it is conspiring with a few other factors. Among them is that the last winter was unusually cold, which not only increased demand for gas in homes in the UK but also across the globe, driving up prices internationally. Moreover, Russia is supplying less gas than expected, possibly for political reasons, further increasing prices. Oil prices too have shot back up to pre-pandemic levels. All the while, the UK government has made disappointingly slow progress in insulating its homes and building transport infrastructure that does not require fossil fuels. Had there been more progress on the phasing out of fossil fuels from our economy, the energy squeeze would be hitting us less hard.

The supply chain squeeze too is pushing up prices, as a lot of goods around the world are not as readily available as they usually are. At the heart of this is that freight ships are not in the right places, as well as the lingering effects of Covid lockdowns in many countries. There are fewer container ships right now transporting goods from China to Europe and the US as would be needed. This is causing increased shipping prices and means fewer goods are being delivered than consumers are demanding. And some specific goods are in short supply. Take for example the shortage of semiconductors: these small chips that run our computers and cars are the world’s fourth most traded good. Demand for them skyrocketed during the pandemic all the while their production, in Taiwan and Malaysia, was affected by Covid shutdowns.

Next comes the global Covid bounce. Prices are going up as the global economy kicks back into gear. People are buying cars and petrol to fuel them, they are returning to hotels and malls. As a result, businesses are cautiously ending their customer discounts from the past year. Indeed, inflation went up significantly in the UK compared with a year ago partly because Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” scheme had reduced prices last August. Much of this is positive: it shows that many people’s incomes have held up until now, and that businesses are feeling demand for their goods is coming back.

There are also some other factors more specific to the UK pushing up inflation. The UK is experiencing labour shortages in some sectors – most prominently HGV drivers, including those delivering petrol. This is due to longstanding shortcoming in training and working conditions. But it also because a lot of people have dropped out of the labour force, with young people going into education and older people retiring. It has been exacerbated by the government’s Brexit plan, which has reportedly shut many drivers out. The UK also has a worse gas price problem because its system has been marred by low storage capacity and operational problems. However, it is global factors that are relatively more important, making it difficult for the government to do much to stop the short-term rise in inflation.

As a result of these pressures, UK inflation has hit 3% in the year to August, and the Bank of England is expecting it to reach 4%, and possibly more, by the end of the year. This would be twice the intended rate.

Though the factors driving up inflation are varied, most of them are expected to reverse by the middle of next year. Problems with shipping may now have peaked, while producers are investing in producing more semiconductors. Russia said it is ready to raise gas supply. However, this cannot be taken for granted.

In the face of this inflationary pressure, the question is whether anything can be done at home to mitigate it? The Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation in Britain at the 2% target, but its options are limited as it obviously cannot control those global factors. It has to walk a tightrope. It might soon start to reverse the cheap financing conditions introduced during the pandemic, easing price pressures. But if it does so too abruptly, it could choke off the recovery and do more harm than good.

While options to halt inflation rises are limited, the government, meanwhile, does have the means to alleviate some of the problems it is causing – especially addressing the cost-of-living crisis for low earners. Firstly, the government should reverse its decision to cut universal credit which is slashing the incomes of 5.5 million families by £1,040 a year. The combination of high inflation and the benefits cut means that, for example, a working single parent who is reliant on universal credit could see their real income fall by 7%. It is the biggest overnight cut to social security since the foundation of the welfare state and it needs to be reversed.

Second, the government should increase public investment to support the recovery while also addressing some of underlying domestic pressures that are contributing to inflation. Public investment should increase, with a boost to green infrastructure. This could generate 1.6 million green jobs, while easing inflationary pressures caused by volatile energy prices. Other investment should go into social infrastructure, including skills and education, to address the UK skills shortage.

Being better prepared for the next crisis has been a salient lesson of the last 18 months: while global underlying factors aren’t going to simply disappear, the government still has things it can do to limit the risks from inflation in the future."

The New York Times emphasized “weak” jobs growth and fretted that “hiring challenges that have bedeviled employers all year won’t be quickly resolved,” and “rising wages could add to concerns about inflation.” For CNN, it was “another disappointment”. For Bloomberg the “September jobs report misses big for a second straight month”.

The media failed to report the big story, which is actually a very good one: American workers are now flexing their muscles for the first time in decades.

You might say workers have declared a national general strike until they get better pay and improved working conditions.

No one calls it a general strike. But in its own disorganized way it’s related to the organized strikes breaking out across the land – Hollywood TV and film crews, John Deere workers, Alabama coal miners, Nabisco workers, Kellogg workers, nurses in California, healthcare workers in Buffalo.

Disorganized or organized, American workers now have bargaining leverage to do better. After a year and a half of the pandemic, consumers have pent-up demand for all sorts of goods and services.

But employers are finding it hard to fill positions.

Last Friday’s jobs report showed the number of job openings at a record high. The share of people working or actively looking for work (the labor force participation rate) has dropped to 61.6%. Participation for people in their prime working years, defined as 25 to 54 years old, is also down.

Over the past year, job openings have increased 62%. Yet overall hiring has actually declined.

What gives?

Another clue: Americans are also quitting their jobs at the highest rate on record. The Department of Labor reported on Tuesday that some 4.3 million people quit their jobs in August. That comes to about 2.9% of the workforce – up from the previous record set in April, of about 4 million people quitting.

All told, about 4 million American workers have been leaving their jobs every month since the spring.

These numbers have nothing to do with the Republican bogeyman of extra unemployment benefits supposedly discouraging people from working. Reminder: the extra benefits ran out on Labor Day.

Renewed fears of the Delta variant of Covid may play some role. But it can’t be the largest factor. With most adults now vaccinated, rates of hospitalizations and deaths are way down.

My take: workers are reluctant to return to or remain in their old jobs mostly because they’re burned out.

Some have retired early. Others have found ways to make ends meet other than remain in jobs they abhor. Many just don’t want to return to backbreaking or mind-numbing low-wage shit jobs.

The media and most economists measure the economy’s success by the number of jobs it creates, while ignoring the quality of those jobs. That’s a huge oversight.

Years ago, when I was secretary of labor, I kept meeting working people all over the country who had full-time work but complained that their jobs paid too little and had few benefits, or were unsafe, or required lengthy or unpredictable hours. Many said their employers treated them badly, harassed them, and did not respect them.

Since then, these complaints have only grown louder, according to polls. For many, the pandemic was the last straw. Workers are fed up, wiped out, done-in, and run down. In the wake of so much hardship, illness and death during the past year, they’re not going to take it anymore.

In order to lure workers back, employers are raising wages and offering other inducements. Average earnings rose 19 cents an hour in September and are up more than $1 an hour – or 4.6% – over the last year.

Clearly, that’s not enough.

Corporate America wants to frame this as a “labor shortage.” Wrong. What’s really going on is more accurately described as a living-wage shortage, a hazard pay shortage, a childcare shortage, a paid sick leave shortage, and a healthcare shortage.

Unless these shortages are rectified, many Americans won’t return to work anytime soon. I say it’s about time."

Democrats, who narrowly control the House, maintained party discipline to pass the hard-fought, $480bn debt limit increase. The vote was along party lines, with every yes from Democrats and every no from Republicans.

Joe Biden is expected to sign the measure into law this week, before 18 October, when the treasury department has estimated it would no longer be able to pay the nation’s debts without congressional action.

Republicans insist Democrats should take responsibility for raising the debt limit because they want to spend trillions of dollars to expand social programs and tackle climate change. Democrats say the increased borrowing authority is needed largely to cover the cost of tax cuts and spending programs during Donald Trump’s administration, which House Republicans supported.

House passage warded off concerns that the world’s largest economy would go into default for the first time, but only for about seven weeks, setting the stage for continued fighting between the parties.

The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell wrote to Biden on Friday that he would not work with Democrats on another debt limit increase. McConnell was harshly criticized by Trump, the Republican party’s leader, after the Senate vote.

Lawmakers also have only until 3 December to pass spending legislation to prevent a government shutdown.

The Senate’s vote last week to raise the limit – which had been more routine before the current era of fierce partisanship – turned into a brawl. Republicans tried to link the measure to Biden’s goal of passing multitrillion-dollar legislation to bolster infrastructure and social services while fighting climate change.

At a news conference on Tuesday, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she was optimistic that Democrats could work out changes to reduce the cost of their social policy plans “in a timely fashion”.

In another sign compromise was possible, progressive Democrats told reporters that most of them wanted to keep all the proposed programs in the multitrillion-dollar plan, while shortening the time period to cut its overall cost.

Biden has suggested a range of more like $2tn rather than the initial $3.5tn target. At a briefing today, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters: “We are at a point where there are choices that need to be made, given that there are fewer dollars that will be spent.”

Psaki said that the conversations are ongoing between White House senior staff and the president as well as key Democrats such as senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona about how to trim the bill and what a smaller package would look like.

Psaki was asked if the president supported Pelosi’s strategy for the “Build Back Better” bill outlined in a letter she sent to caucus members on Monday, passing a bill with fewer programs that will receive more funding. Though she wouldn’t confirm if the president supported that specific strategy, Psaki noted that the bill would be smaller versus the $3.5tn Biden originally proposed and referred to comments Pelosi made during her press conference.

“What [Pelosi] said in that press conference is that ‘if there are fewer dollars to be spent, there are choices that need to be made’, and the president agrees … If it’s smaller than $3.5tn, which we know it will be, then there are choices that need to be made,” said Psaki.

“A bill that doesn’t pass means nothing changes,” Psaki said.

Plans by online retailer THG to win support from shareholders for its strategy backfired spectacularly on Tuesday after an investor day sparked a sell-off that wiped a third from its share price.

The retailer, formerly known as The Hut Group, which is run by its founder Matt Moulding, held a capital markets day, where it shared its 2030 sustainability strategy with investors.

But investors took fright at the update and concerns that Japanese investment giant SoftBank’s support for THG was cooling, drove down its share price almost 35% from Monday’s closing price of 437p, to close at 285p on Tuesday.

That wiped £1.85bn from the company’s market value, taking it down to £3.48bn from £5.33bn at the start of the day.



The Manchester-based e-commerce specialist owns a range of online beauty and nutrition brands including Lookfantastic and Myprotein, and is also planning to expand its role as a technology provider, helping brands such as Unilever and Danone to sell directly to consumers.

It has been less than 13 months since THG first floated on the London Stock Exchange in September 2020, with an offer price of 500p per share, which valued the business at £4.5bn....

So is the bounceback in Europe and the US, where the Biden administration is trying to piece together another major stimulus package to bridge the gap between pre- and post-pandemic job markets.

But the loss of momentum across the G7 is small and governments can afford to offset a spike in fuel prices that will dent business profits and household incomes over the winter months, says the International Monetary Fund.

Much more important, says the Washington-based organisation, is the threat to global growth from a lack of Covid-19 vaccines in south-east Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America.

Without a speedier rollout of vaccines to low income and developing countries, the dislocation between the affluent west and the global south will widen.

Appealing to the self-interest of rich nations, the IMF spelled out in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) how the hoarding of vaccines would soon be a source of regret for all. Europe and the US will be hurt if imports of raw materials and vital components never make it out of countries dealing with escalating Covid-19 deaths and lockdowns well into next year.

IMF boss Kristalina Georgieva has joined the World Health Organization in calling for a vaccine patent waiver to allow pharmaceutical companies in the developing world to copy the vaccine code and make their own.

When the most popular vaccines made by US firms Pfizer and Moderna need to be kept at ultra-low temperatures, it is vital that vaccines be made close to the populations they need to inoculate.

Lower-income countries cannot afford to pay Pfizer’s prices at the best of times, and certainly not when plans by the G20 group of nations to ease their debt burdens fall flat. While developed economies have generated a 0.9% increase in output across all industries above pre-pandemic levels, output in low-income countries is still 6.7% below pre-pandemic levels, said the IMF.

The Jubilee Debt Campaign said its latest analysis of countries that applied to take part in a G20 initiative to cancel or suspend $20bn (£14.7bn) of debt have only managed to agree $10.9bn during the pandemic. In the meantime, they have paid $36.4bn on external debt payments, mostly to private banks and hedge funds.

This is money they can ill afford to spend when their hospitals are still full of Covid-19 patients and the price of food and basic household items is soaring.

The IMF, which is charged with being the lender of last resort to stricken governments, has brokered a programme to bring down debt interest rates but in most cases not the overall debt bill. Chief economist Gita Gopinath was explicit that social unrest in many countries was just around the corner without further support.

Social unrest might also be a concern in the west if central banks begin to increase interest rates at the same time fuel bills are escalating, job protection programmes are coming to an end and tax rises lay in wait, as is the case in the UK.

In a separate chapter of the WEO, the IMF takes a swipe at central banks that have allowed speculators in financial markets to bring forward bets on when interest rates are likely to increase.

Without mentioning the Bank of England, which has faced similar criticism from a range of economists, the IMF said that inflation pressures would be temporary, even though the fuel crisis was more severe than it forecast when its last outlook was produced in April.

Similarly, vacancy rates are predicted to fall and wage rises cool as the pandemic after-effects wane next year. Inflation might still be well above the usual central bank target of 2%. If it is, an increase in interest rates will do little to bring it down given that most of the price increases flow from imported gas and petrol that will be used in the winter. If it isn’t, then it will only be because households have shivered their way through the cold weather.

In short, central banks should resist removing supporting struts from the bridge to a post-pandemic world while vulnerable people are still crossing it, just as wealthy governments must extend a strong hand to those in low-income countries that are still battling Covid-19."

He’s constantly tooting her horn and gushing over her talents. Not only does Ivanka have a “very nice figure”, Trump has boasted, but “she’s very good with numbers”. She’s so good at all that numbers stuff that the former president even considered her for the top job at the World Bank in 2019. And that wasn’t just a fleeting fantasy, either; according to a recent report by the Intercept, Ivanka’s nomination for World Bank president “came incredibly close to happening”. The reason it didn’t is that Trump’s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, intervened. Which, by the way is a rather different story from the one Ivanka tells. The former first daughter has said she passed on the job because she was very happy with the high-powered White House position she’d appointed herself to.

I can’t say I’m surprised that Ivanka was a stone’s throw away from a(nother) prestigious job she was laughably unqualified for. What does intrigue me is why Mnuchin might have blocked her nomination. Trump has a knack of surrounding himself with sycophants who do his bidding; what could have prompted Mnuchin to break ranks? Could it possibly be that the guy finds brazen nepotism distasteful? Alas, it seems unlikely, considering he’s a product of it himself. Mnuchin’s first job out of Yale was at Goldman Sachs, where his dad just happened to be a general partner. According to a New York magazine profile, Mnuchin’s colleagues at Goldman Sachs didn’t consider him “especially book smart”, but that didn’t stop him becoming partner himself. The same profile notes that his elevation to partner came at the expense of an African American trader from a working-class background who struck one colleague as being “much smarter than Steven” and having “accomplished a lot more”. I don’t know how fair that profile is, but I’d bet both my kidneys that Mnuchin isn’t someone who stays awake at night fretting about nepotism.

So perhaps Mnuchin was afraid Ivanka’s appointment might be unethical or make the US look ridiculous? Again, these theories seem unlikely. Mnuchin and his (third) wife, the Scottish actor Louise Linton, don’t seem particularly bothered by ethics or looking ridiculous. Mnuchin, after all, is nicknamed the “foreclosure king” because he made a ton of money evicting elderly people from their homes. Linton, meanwhile, is notorious for having written a “white saviour” memoir full of dubious claims. The pair haven’t exactly kept a low profile since getting together. Remember when the lovebirds did a very weird supervillain-style photoshoot with a sheet of new dollar bills? Not exactly something someone concerned about optics might do. Then there was the time they took a government plane to see a solar eclipse in Kentucky. Linton posted the trip on Instagram and hashtagged all the designer labels she was wearing: “#rolandmouret pants”, “#tomford sunnies”, “#hermesscarf”, “#valentinorockstudheels”. The whole thing was #inverybadtaste.

The pair haven’t exactly tried to tone it down since then. Linton recently made a movie called Me You Madness where she plays a “materialistic, narcissistic, self-absorbed misanthrope” who hates commercial air travel, loves high fashion and eats men for fun. It also contains spider sex. Mnuchin has been very supportive of the movie, calling the escapades of a greedy sociopath “highly entertaining”. Again, he doesn’t seem like the sort of guy who cares what other people think. Rather, he seems like the sort of guy who actively supports narcissistic blonds (Linton looks quite a bit like Ivanka) with white saviour complexes and enormous egos doing whatever the hell they like. If he blocked Ivanka’s nomination then I’ll once again wager my kidneys that it wasn’t for the common good, but it was somehow for his own good. After all, nepotism simply isn’t a problem for people like Mnuchin. It’s just the way the world works."

Policymakers were faced with a “challenging” trade-off between continuing to support economic activity while preventing unintended consequences and medium-term financial stability risks, the IMF said in its half-yearly Global Financial Stability Review (GFSR).

Noting that share prices appeared to be overvalued and house prices had risen rapidly in many countries, the Washington-based body said investors were becoming increasingly concerned about the economic outlook amid rising virus infections and greater uncertainty about the strength of the recovery, particularly in emerging markets.

It said: “Warning signs – for example, increased financial risk-taking and rising fragilities in the nonbank financial institutions sector – point to a deterioration in the underlying financial stability foundations. If left unchecked, these vulnerabilities may evolve into structural legacy problems, putting medium-term growth at risk and testing the resilience of the global financial system.”

The release came at the start of the IMF’s annual meeting, with the agenda dominated by concerns about risks to global growth and the cloud hanging over the fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.

The IMF’s executive board said there was no conclusive information to support allegations that Georgieva acted improperly when she was deputy president of the World Bank in 2018 and reaffirmed its ”full confidence” in her leadership.

The GFSR was more upbeat about the financial position of households, which it said was better than during the global financial crisis of 2007-09, while banks were also in a much stronger position this time around.

In a separate report released on Tuesday, the IMF told rich countries to make good on their vaccine and climate change promises to developing nations as it warned of a dangerous divergence in economic prospects around the globe.

It revised down its growth forecasts for many western countries – including the UK – but said its real concern was low-income countries where the picture had become markedly worse.

The IMF’s half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) showed recovery from last year’s collapse in activity was continuing but the momentum had weakened.

Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s economic counsellor, said the global growth projection for 2021 had been revised down marginally from 6% in July to 5.9% and was unchanged for 2022 at 4.9%.

The UK is expected to be the fastest growing of the G7 group of leading industrial nations, although the IMF’s estimate was cut from 7% to 6.8%. The US, Germany, Japan and Canada also had their growth estimates revised down.

Gopinath said the impact of the pandemic had been much harder on low-income countries, which were also at greater risk of being affected by climate change.

She said these divergences were a consequence of the “great vaccine divide” and large disparities in policy support. While more than 60% of the population in advanced economies were fully vaccinated and some were receiving booster shots, about 96% of the population in low-income countries remained unvaccinated.

“The foremost policy priority is therefore to vaccinate at least 40% of the population in every country by the end of 2021 and 70% by mid-2022.

Looking ahead to next month’s UN climate change conference in Glasgow, Gopinath said another urgent priority was the need to slow the rise in global temperatures and contain the growing adverse effects of the climate crisis. This required more ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“A policy strategy that includes an international carbon price floor adjusted to country circumstances, a green public investment and research subsidy push, and compensatory, targeted transfers to households can help advance the energy transition in an equitable way. Just as importantly, advanced countries need to deliver on their earlier promises of mobilising $100bn [£73bn] billion of annual climate financing for developing countries.”"

The death of the 69-year-old veteran backbencher brought heartfelt tributes from all parties. Just five years after the murder of Jo Cox, it also prompted renewed worries about the security risks for MPs in an increasingly rancorous and polarised political era.

A 25-year-old man, believed to be a Briton with Somali heritage, is in custody and has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Sources have told the Guardian he has the same details as someone who had previously been referred to the Prevent scheme, the official programme for those thought at risk of radicalisation.

In a statement, the Metropolitan police said the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, had formally declared the incident as terrorism. The early investigation has revealed “a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism”, the force said.



As part of the investigation, officers are searching two addresses in the London area, the Met said. The force believe the man acted alone and are not seeking anyone else at the moment.

Essex police had briefed counter-terrorism policing headquarters about details of the attack and suspect throughout Friday afternoon. MI5, the domestic Security Service, was also monitoring the investigation.

Amess, who had represented Southend West since 1997, and had previously been the MP for the nearby Essex seat of Basildon from 1983, was stabbed several times at the constituency event at a church in Leigh-on-Sea late on Friday morning.

Paramedics treated Amess at the scene, but were unable to save his life.

In a statement to the media outside Southend police station, the chief constable of Essex, Ben-Julian Harrington, said police and paramedics arrived at the scene “within minutes” of being called.

“When they arrived, they found Sir David Amess MP, who had suffered multiple injuries. This was a difficult incident, but our officers and paramedics worked extremely hard to save Sir David. Tragically, he died at the scene.”

News of the attack prompted shock and revulsion both in the constituency, where Amess was a well-known and visible figure, and from other MPs, faith leaders and others. Flags were flown at half-mast at Downing Street and parliament.

Priti Patel has ordered an immediate review of MPs’ security. A spokesman said: “The home secretary has asked all police forces to review security arrangements for MPs with immediate effect and will provide updates in due course.”

The Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said the killing would “send shock waves across the parliamentary community and the whole country”, adding: “In the coming days we will need to discuss and examine MPs’ security and any measures to be taken.”

John Lamb, Conservative councillor for the neighbouring ward of West Leigh and a former leader of the council, said Amess would hold his advice surgeries in a range of locations because “he wanted to come out and about and meet people”.

Lamb said he had learned of the attack from a party colleague, who had been in touch with people who were with Amess at the church. “They phoned her up to say: ‘David’s been stabbed several times,’” Lamb said. “I came straight over.”

Kevin Buck, the councillor for Prittlewell ward and a friend of Amess, said the MP’s assistant and PA were both with him when he was attacked, adding: “I would imagine they are traumatised, because they would have seen the whole thing.”

As news of the attack emerged, there were desperate hopes that the MP’s life could be saved, with an air ambulance sent to the scene. But just over two hours later, police released an updated statement saying the man attacked had died, subsequently confirming this was Amess.

Tributes flooded in from MPs across the political spectrum, many of them highlighting Amess’s 38-year career in the Commons, one spent entirely on the backbenches, as a champion of causes including animal rights and better treatment for endometriosis.

In a brief TV interview, Boris Johnson said he was “deeply shocked and heart-stricken” at the news. The prime minister said: “Above all, he was one of the kindest, nicest and most gentle people in politics. And he also had an outstanding record of passing laws to help the most vulnerable.

“We’ve lost today a fine public servant, and a much-loved friend and colleague, and our thoughts are very much today with his wife, his children and his family.”

Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, called it “a dark and shocking day”, adding: “The whole country will feel it acutely, perhaps the more so because we have, heartbreakingly, been here before.”

It was in 2016, shortly before the Brexit referendum, when Cox, a Labour MP, was killed shortly before holding a surgery in her constituency, raising worries about the safety of MPs and the extent of threats and other intimidation many receive on a routine basis.

Brendan Cox, her widower, tweeted: “Attacking our elected representatives is an attack on democracy itself. There is no excuse, no justification. It is as cowardly as it gets.”

Kim Leadbeater, Cox’s sister, who was elected as an MP for the same seat of Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire in July, said the news had left her “scared and frightened”. She said: “My phone started going straight away, my mum and dad, my partner, my friends – ‘Are you OK?’ – and I was OK, I was visiting a school. But the shock and the feelings for us as a family, obviously what we went through and another family are going through that again, it’s horrific.”

In 2010, another Labour MP, Stephen Timms, was stabbed twice at a constituency surgery by a student radicalised by online videos. In 2000, Andrew Pennington, an assistant to the Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones, was stabbed to death as he tried to protect Jones from an attacker who stormed his constituency office armed with a sword."

The decision taken by foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), at an emergency meeting on Friday night, marks a rare bold step for the consensus-driven bloc, which has traditionally favoured a policy of engagement and non-interference.

Singapore’s foreign ministry said on Saturday the move to exclude junta chief Min Aung Hlaing was a “difficult but necessary decision to uphold Asean’s credibility”.

The statement went on to cite the lack of progress made on a roadmap to restore peace in Myanmar that the junta had agreed with Asean in April.

More than 1,000 civilians have been killed by Myanmar security forces and thousands arrested, according to the UN, amid a crackdown on strikes and protests which has derailed the country’s tentative democracy and prompted international condemnation.

The junta says those estimates of the death toll are exaggerated.

Asean’s current chair, Brunei, said a non-political figure from Myanmar would be invited to the summit on 26-28 October, after no consensus was reached for a political representative to attend.

“As there had been insufficient progress ... as well as concerns over Myanmar*s commitment, in particular on establishing constructive dialogue among all concerned parties, some Asean member states recommended that Asean give space to Myanmar to restore its internal affairs and return to normalcy,” Brunei said in a statement.

It did not mention Min Aung Hlaing or name who would be invited in his stead.

Brunei said some member states had received requests from Myanmar’s national unity government, formed by opponents of the junta, to attend the summit.

Asean has faced increasing international pressure to take a tougher stand against Myanmar, having been criticised in the past for its ineffectiveness in dealing with leaders accused of rights abuses, subverting democracy and intimidating political opponents.

A US State Department official told reporters on Friday that it was “perfectly appropriate and in fact completely justified” for Asean to downgrade Myanmar’s participation at the coming summit.

Singapore in its statement urged Myanmar to cooperate with Asean’s envoy, Brunei’s second foreign affairs minister, Erywan Yusof.

Erywan has delayed a long-planned visit to the country in recent weeks and has asked to meet all parties in Myanmar, including deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained in the coup.

Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said this week Erywan would be welcome in Myanmar, but would not be allowed to meet Aung San Suu Kyi because she is charged with crimes."

The government is poised to publish its long-awaited net zero strategy on Monday, setting out how the UK will meet its targets to cut CO 2 emissions by 78% by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050. This will also include the heat and buildings strategy for insulating draughty homes and phasing out gas boilers, along with a massive expansion of offshore wind, and building electric vehicle charging networks.

But green campaigners are concerned that the strategies, put forward by Kwasi Kwarteng are being hamstrung by opposition from Rishi Sunak, who is refusing to provide adequate funding.

Failure to put forward a viable and well-funded blueprint for reaching net zero would destroy the UK’s credibility at a crucial time, campaigners have said, just weeks before the UN Cop26 climate talks, which begin in Glasgow at the end of this month.

Ed Matthew, campaign director at green thinktank E3G, said: “To achieve an ambitious outcome at Cop26, the government has to lead by example. If they don’t have their own house in order on how to reach net zero, how are they going to persuade the rest of the world to get on track? The whole diplomatic strategy is absolutely dependent on having a credible plan in place in the UK.”

Kwarteng has spoken publicly in favour of decarbonising electricity generation by 2035, and is pushing net zero behind the scenes. This is a new departure for the business secretary, who comes from a strongly free-market viewpoint, as one of the authors of Britannia Unchained. But insiders claim the pandemic has changed his outlook, and that he has undergone elements of a “green” conversion – though he is also still intent on licensing new oil and gas in the North Sea.

“With the pandemic and the energy crisis, he is seeing a need for government intervention,” said one close observer. “Energy security is now a key theme, and building renewables can help with that.”

But Sunak, who controls the purse strings, is understood to be strongly opposed to devoting new cash to the climate effort. He was notably silent on the climate, net zero strategy and Cop26 in his speech to the Tory party conference earlier this month.

“It’s astonishing that he did not mention climate change: the single greatest threat the UK economy is facing, and with Cop26 approaching,” said Matthew. “Without the Treasury, we can’t be on track for net zero, because we need not just the policies but investment – this is the litmus test.”

A government source denied any split and told the Guardian: “This is a whole government approach: every department has signed up to net zero and the prime minister is the biggest proponent of this agenda. The preparation of the strategy with the Treasury has been smooth.”

The Treasury is also due to publish on Monday its own net zero findings, in the form of a review that is expected to set out the costs of reaching net zero. The Treasury net zero review is controversial among green experts, as the Guardian understands it will not take account of the many benefits of cutting emissions, including green jobs, lower energy bills and health improvements from cutting air pollution, as well as reducing the impacts of extreme weather.

“It’s as if the Stern review never happened,” said one expert, referring to the landmark 2006 study by climate economist Nicholas Stern, which found the short-term costs of cutting emissions were far outweighed by the economic benefits. “They have stuck to their old pre-Stern models of cost.”

Green campaigners believe the Treasury review will be seized on by climate sceptics in the Tory ranks. They are also concerned that lobbying by the fossil fuel industry has persuaded the government to make hydrogen a leading part of its net zero strategy. That would be a mistake, they argue, as some forms of hydrogen are not low-CO 2 , but require fossil fuels to be converted into hydrogen and the resulting CO 2 stored, in contrast with genuine green hydrogen methods, by which hydrogen is manufactured using renewable energy.

“Hydrogen boilers are greenwash,” said Matthew. “They will massively increase energy bills. If they’re considering hydrogen, that’s a bad sign.”

Kat Kramer, global climate lead at the charity Christian Aid, said: “The government is currently promoting false solutions that effectively subsidise the fossil fuel industry. It is crazy that they plan to use taxpayers’ money to promote hydrogen made from fossil gas rather than renewables, and for capturing carbon from burned fossil fuels and storing it underground.”

A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are absolutely committed to meeting our world-leading climate commitments and the prime minister’s 10-point plan set out £12bn of investment for green industries. “

But they stressed the importance of private sector investment, adding: “Government alone cannot achieve net zero, which is why we are working with the private sector to boost investment and leading the world in green finance.”"

Seven of the mysterious space rocks are among swarms of asteroids sharing Jupiter’s orbit, thought to be the pristine leftovers of planetary formation.

An Atlas V rocket blasted off before dawn on Saturday, sending Lucy on a roundabout orbital journey spanning nearly 4bn miles (6.3bn km). “I’m just elated,” Nasa’s associate administrator, Robert Cabana, said after liftoff. “This is the coolest darn mission.”

Lucy is named after the 3.2m-year-old skeletal remains of a human ancestor found in Ethiopia nearly half a century ago. That discovery got its name from the 1967 Beatles song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, prompting Nasa to send the spacecraft soaring with band members’ lyrics and other luminaries’ words of wisdom imprinted on a plaque. The spacecraft also carried a disc made of lab-grown diamonds for one of its science instruments.

In a prerecorded video for Nasa, the Beatles drummer, Ringo Starr, paid tribute to his late colleague John Lennon, credited for writing the song.

“Lucy is going back in the sky with diamonds. Johnny will love that,” Starr said. “Anyway, if you meet anyone up there, Lucy, give them peace and love from me.”

00:31 'Johnny'll love that': Ringo Starr wishes Nasa Lucy mission well – video

The paleoanthropologist behind the discovery of the Lucy remains, Donald Johanson, said he was filled with wonder about this “intersection of our past, our present and our future.”

“That a human ancestor who lived so long ago stimulated a mission which promises to add valuable information about the formation of our solar system is incredibly exciting,” said Johanson, of Arizona tate University, who travelled to Cape Canaveral in Florida for the launch.

Lucy’s $981m (£715m) mission is the first to aim for Jupiter’s so-called Trojan entourage: thousands – if not millions – of asteroids that share the gas giant’s expansive orbit around the sun. Some of the Trojan asteroids precede Jupiter in its orbit, while others trail it.

Despite their orbits, the Trojans are far from the planet and mostly scattered far from each other. So there is essentially zero chance of Lucy getting clobbered by one as it swoops past its targets, said Southwest Research Institute’s Hal Levison, the mission’s principal scientist.

Lucy will swoop past Earth next October and again in 2024 to get enough gravitational oomph to make it all the way out to Jupiter’s orbit. On the way there, the spacecraft will zip past asteroid Donaldjohanson between Mars and Jupiter. The aptly named rock will serve as a 2025 warmup act for the science instruments.

Drawing power from two huge circular solar wings, Lucy will chase down five asteroids in the leading pack of Trojans in the late 2020s. The spacecraft will then swoop back toward Earth for another gravity assist in 2030 that will swing it back out to the trailing Trojan cluster, where it will zip past the final two targets in 2033.

Lucy will pass within 600 miles of each target; the biggest is about 70 miles across.

“Are there mountains? Valleys? Pits? Mesas? Who knows? I’m sure we’re going to be surprised,” said Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins University, who is in charge of Lucy’s black-and-white camera. “But we can hardly wait to see what ... images will reveal about these fossils from the formation of the solar system.”"

The government deployed paramilitary troops to 22 districts after religious tensions and violence broke out in the city of Cumilla on Wednesday.

It was sparked by videos and allegations that spread across social media that a Qur’an, the Muslim holy book, had been placed on the knee of a statue of the Hindu god Hanuman, in a shrine set up for the Hindu holy festival of Durga Puja.

Mobs of more than 500 people gathered in Cumilla and neighbouring districts over the alleged blasphemy. About 10 Hindu temples and shrines were attacked and vandalised by the crowds, who threw stones and smashed statues of the Hindu goddess Durga.

In Cumilla, police shot teargas and fired on the crowds. At least three people died at the scene and another later died of their injuries. Dozens, including several police officers, were injured.

On Friday, the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina promised severe action in response. “The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated,” said Hasina. Nobody will be spared. It doesn’t matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished.”

Md Faridul Haque Khan, the state minister for religious affairs, said the incident involving the Qur’an would be investigated but added that communal harmony should be protected and urged people not to take the law into their own hands.

Obaidul Quader, a minister with the ruling Awami League government, visited a Hindu shrine in the aftermath of the violence. He said that “fanatic elements” were responsible for the attacks on the Hindu religious festival, adding that the government would “not let them proceed with their evil design”.

The Bangladesh Hindu Unity Council said in a tweet that it “could not publish” what had happened over the past 24 hours, but stated that “the Hindus of Bangladesh saw the real faces of some people. We don’t know what will happen in the future. But the Hindus of Bangladesh will never forget Durga Puja in 2021”.

Hindu religious leaders alleged that the attacks were part of a conspiracy to attack the Hindu community of Bangladesh. Hindus make up 10% of the Muslim-majority country.

In August, four Hindu temples were attacked in the country’s Khulna district and in March, during a visit by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, hardline Islamist groups attacked Hindu shrines.

The incident on Thursday prompted outrage in neighbouring Hindu-majority India. On Thursday, Indian government spokesperson Arindam Bagchi described the incident as “disturbing” and said officials were in communication with the Bangladesh authorities about the attacks."

Labour MP Tulip Siddiq said Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s sentence of one year plus a one-year travel ban has been “upheld with no court hearing”.

The Hampstead and Kilburn MP has urged Boris Johnson to intervene in the case.

Siddiq tweeted on Saturday: “Just spoke to my constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard.

“Nazanin has lost her latest appeal and her sentence of 1 year plus 1 year travel ban is upheld with no court hearing. She could now be returned to prison at any time. The PM must act now to #FreeNazanin.”

Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national, has been in custody in the country since 2016 after being accused of plotting to overthrow the government.

She was taking her daughter, Gabriella, to see her family when she was arrested and was sentenced to five years in jail shortly afterwards, spending four years in Tehran’s Evin prison.

She spent the final year of her sentence under house arrest in Tehran, but after her release this year was convicted of “spreading propaganda against the regime”.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family have reportedly been told by Iranian authorities that she is being detained because of the UK’s failure to pay an outstanding £400m debt to Iran.

She is one of several people with British or dual-British nationality detained in Iran.

Her husband Richard Ratcliffe, Siddiq and Amnesty International have been campaigning for her release for several years.

Last month, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, met her Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, at the UN general assembly, where she “pressed” him on the issue and vowed to “continue to press” until Zaghari-Ratcliffe returns home.

Details of Rumayyan’s role – including the transfer of a charter jet company to the Public Investment Fund (PIF), where he serves as governor – are contained in court documents that shed light on his relationship with Prince Mohammed.

The inner workings of the PIF have been a source of intense interest after it led a consortium that acquired Newcastle United this month. The state-owned sovereign wealth fund is run by Rumayyan and chaired by the crown prince.

The Saudi-led consortium withdrew its bid to acquire Newcastle in 2020 amid concerns that the PIF was part the Saudi state. But the Premier League approved the deal this month and said it had been given “legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control” the club. The Premier League has not disclosed the nature of the assurances.

Internal Saudi documents filed to a civil court in Canada as part of an unrelated case show that in 2017 a close aide to Prince Mohammed ordered Rumayyan – who is formally referred to in memos as “his excellency” and the “supervisor” of the PIF – to transfer 20 companies to the sovereign wealth fund as part of the anti-corruption campaign.

One of 20 seized companies, the documents show, was a charter jet company that was later alleged to have been used in the Saudi plot to kill Jamal Khashoggi. US intelligence agencies concluded in an intelligence report that was declassified in February that Prince Mohammed approved Khashoggi’s gruesome murder.

There is no suggestion that Rumayyan had any involvement in or knowledge of the alleged use of the jets in the operation that killed the Washington Post journalist.

The documents suggest, however, that a senior aide to the crown prince was able to order Rumayyan to take actions related to the PIF on Prince Mohammed’s behalf. The PIF declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Saudi embassy in Washington did not return a request for comment.

Rumayyan is a former banker who serves as governor of the PIF and chairman of the oil firm Saudi Aramco. He has overseen billions of dollars in investment by the PIF, including in Uber, Facebook, Disney and Citibank.

The Harvard Business School-educated executive is reportedly due to attend his first Newcastle match on Sunday in his new role as non-executive chairman of the club.

The internal Saudi documents were filed in a Canadian court as part of a civil case that has been brought by Saudi-owned entities against a former senior Saudi intelligence official, Saad Aljabri, a critic of Prince Mohammed who in turn has accused the Saudi government of trying to assassinate him in Canada. The Saudi government has denied the claims.

The court records include copies of memos that were sent to his “excellency the supervisor of the Public Investment Fund” by Mohammad al-Sheikh, a senior Saudi adviser to Prince Mohammed.

They relate to the infamous anti-corruption campaign led by the crown prince from November 2017, when 400 of Saudi Arabia’s richest individuals – including princes and ministers – were rounded up and held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh in what was later condemned by witnesses and critics as a purge involving torture, coercion and the expropriation of billions in assets into Saudi coffers.

Mohammad al-Sheikh, the close adviser to the crown prince, defended the campaign in a 2018 interview on CBS. “The anti-corruption crackdown was very simple. We had a serious problem with corruption,” he said. “We had to do what we did at the Ritz.”

The memos are labelled “top secret, not for circulation and very urgent”. The first memo, sent on 22 December 2017, calls on Rumayyan to “transfer” a number of companies to the PIF’s ownership that were seized as part of the anti-corruption purge.

The second memo, dated two days later, repeats the order with greater urgency and tells Rumayyan to “immediately approve the completion of the necessary procedures”.

Saudi documents filed to the court show that in response, Rumayyan sent a handwritten and signed memo on 26 December 2017 to an associate ordering him to “do what’s necessary as fast as possible” to comply with the order. Among the 20 companies included on a list to be transferred to the PIF was Sky Prime Aviation Services, a charter jet company based in Riyadh.

The name of the charter jet company resurfaced in 2019 in a report by Agnes Callamard, the former UN special rapporteur who investigated the Khashoggi killing. She concluded that the team of Saudi agents who killed the journalist used two jets operated by Sky Prime Aviation to travel to and from Istanbul before the murder in the Saudi consulate on October 2018.

CNN first reported in February 2021 that court documents showed that the two private jets used by the Saudi assassination squad were owned by a company that had previously been seized by Prince Mohammed. But other details from the court documents relating to Rumayyan’s role in PIF’s acquisition of the charter jet firm and other companies have not previously been reported.

The PIF declined to respond to a request for comment from Rumayyan and did not respond to a question about the control of Sky Prime Aviation Services. The Saudi embassy in Washington and the Premier League also declined to comment.

Rumayyan has in the past described the abrupt manner in which he was selected by the crown prince to lead the PIF as governor in 2015. “I received a call … The crown prince heard of me. I got the call. I thought it was an interview [to lead the PIF], but it was, like: ‘Here is what I want you to do. One, two, three,’” Rumayyan said in a 2020 interview with the Carlyle Group chief executive, David Rubenstein.

After Rumayyan initially said he could start the job in three months, the crown prince told him he had “one month, and you will do it”. A week later Prince Mohammed called back and told Rumayyan he was starting “immediately”.

“We are all very proud to be Saudis and to participate in the positive changes the country is living and doing right now,” Rumayyan said in the Rubenstein interview."

Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, the state’s highest Republican in an executive office position, made the remarks at Asbury Baptist church in Seagrove, North Carolina, in June. Right Wing Watch, a project of the advocacy group People For the American Way, posted the video on social media last week.

In the video, Robinson can be heard saying: “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth … And yes, I called it filth, and if you don’t like that I called it filth, come see me and I’ll explain it to you.”

Andrew Bates, a White House deputy press secretary from North Carolina, condemned Robinson’s remarks, saying, “These words are repugnant and offensive. The role of a leader is to bring people together and stand up for the dignity and rights of everyone; not to spread hate and undermine their own office.”

In addition to the White House, Democratic lawmakers and numerous rights groups have criticized Robinson, with some demanding his resignation while others request to meet him to discuss his remarks.

Jeff Jackson, a Democratic state senator and US Senate candidate urged Robinson to quit, tweeting, “Calling many of your own constituents ‘filth’ means you have no intention of representing them. Our Lt Governor should resign and allow someone who is prepared to do the job to take his place. This wasn’t a dog whistle, folks. This was old school hate.”

The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, released a statement saying: “We are calling on Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson to resign for his disgraceful, hateful statements … This is not the first time Robinson has shared his discriminatory views, but it should be the last time he gets away with it as an elected leader.”

Kaye Vassey, a spokesperson from the LGBT Center of Raleigh echoed the HRC’s sentiments, telling the Guardian, “I’m not going down a path of politics but just absolute human rights and the words that he spoke are dangerous to the LGBTQ community, especially to the youth … and it’s a travesty.”

“We did send an open letter saying we would like to set up that meeting and ask for his resignation,” Vassey added, referring to an open letter sent by St John’s Metropolitan Community Church on behalf of various church groups to Robinson.

“Your words have caused considerable harm and you have the potential to cost people their lives. The Trevor Projects estimates that at least one LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13-24 attempts suicide every 45 seconds in the US. This number could be reduced by as much as 40% if an adult in these young people’s lives shares unconditional love with them,” the letter obtained by the Guardian read.

Alisson Scott, director of impact and innovation at Campaign for Southern Equality, told the Guardian, “When he makes these comments, he somehow … tries to roll with the assumption that there are no LGBTQ students in existence and that we’re all somehow just adults and that’s simply false … For him to say this, it’s dangerous, it’s a weapon.”

Robinson, who has since doubled down on his comments, remained defiant, even posting on Facebook that he will not back down nor be silenced. He also said he would continue to fight for the rights of children to receive an education free from sexual concepts that “do not belong in the classroom”.

According to Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow at People For the American Way, Robinson’s act of defiance is “a sign that he is counting on rallying up and motivating the right wing base to carry him over the finish line.”

“I think that’s his political strategy – to use this kind of rhetoric to portray himself as the victim. He’s happy to hurl himself at others but somehow people criticizing him for making bigoted comments prompts him to make him seem like the victim,” Montgomery told the Guardian.

Robinson’s recent comments are only the latest examples of his discrimination against the LGBTQ community. After the 2016 shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Robinson wrote, “I pray for the souls of all those killed … However, homosexuality is STILL an abominable sin.”

In 2019, Robinson accused parents of having “mentally raped” their transgender children while criticizing gender reassignment surgeries."

Wolf, director of Sonoma County Reptile Rescue, said he crawled under the mountainside home in Santa Rosa and found a rattlesnake right away, then another and another. He got out from under the house, grabbed two buckets, put on long, safety gloves, and went back in.

“I kept finding snakes for the next almost four hours,” Wolf said Friday. “I thought, ‘Oh, good, it was a worthwhile call’ but I was happy to get out because it’s not nice, you run into spider webs and dirt and it smells crappy and it’s musty and you’re on your belly and you’re dirty. I mean, it was work.”

But the work paid off. He used a 24in (60cm) snake pole to remove 22 adult rattlesnakes and 59 babies when he first visited the home in the Mayacamas Mountains on 2 October. He returned another two times since and collected 11 more snakes.

All the snakes were northern Pacific rattlesnakes, the only venomous snake found in northern California, he said.

Wolf, who has been rescuing snakes for 32 years and has been bitten 13 times, said he responds to calls about snakes under homes in 17 counties and has seen dozens of them in one place in the wild but never under a home.

He said he releases the rattlesnakes in the wild away from people and sometimes in private land when ranchers request them for pest control.

Wolf said there are plans to return to the house again before the end of the month to see if any more snakes arrived.

“We know it’s a den site already because of the babies, and the amount of females I found,” he said."

Across the city, cinemas filled up and queues formed outside pubs. Salons buzzed with the sound of clippers as people jumped at the opportunity to tame their lockdown hair. Some beachside restaurants are booked up until February.

Thoughts even turned to travel after New South Wales authorities said they would remove quarantine measures for international arrivals, though federal authorities have the ultimate say.

Dee Irwin, 57, was scheduled to have an appointment for a cut and colour at Luxxe Concept Salon on Sydney’s north shore on the day the city was plunged into lockdown. After waiting for five months, she was “over the moon” about coming back.

“When I got the call I nearly had kittens,” she said. “It was the most exciting call I’ve had in the whole of lockdown. I told my husband to stop Netflix … It makes such a difference to how you feel when you wake up in the morning.”

They were scenes that were almost unimaginable four months ago when a Delta outbreak sent the state of New South Wales into a hard lockdown. Then, Australia was lagging behind the rest of the world with vaccination. Israel had already given more than 60% of its population at least one dose and the US over 40% by the time Australia hit 10%. The outlook was bleak.

But the outbreak spurred the nation into action.

A public health disaster

The country’s rollout began in late February and was stymied by delays, supply problems and government missteps. Fifty million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were ordered and then shelved after changing health advice over links to an extremely rare blood-clotting condition.

Negotiations with Pfizer stalled as government representatives dithered and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, declared the nation’s vaccine program was “not a race”.

Public unease towards AstraZeneca compounded delays already made by the decision to secure only 10m doses of Pfizer, a move the company’s former president of global research and development, John LaMattina, later described as “unconscionable”.

The federal government “put most of their eggs in the AstraZeneca basket” and this became “a major problem”, Prof Adrian Esterman, the chair of biostatistics at the University of South Australia, said later.

The problem became a public health disaster when one case of Delta leaked into Sydney via aircrew in June and launched an outbreak that could not be controlled.

Covid-19 infections rose steadily, with more than 2,000 new cases a day being recorded nationally throughout October, mostly across Sydney and Melbourne – the country’s largest cities – and the capital, Canberra, in the country’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began.

Forced to abandon the aim of returning to Covid-zero, vaccination became the only hope for a way out.

“For a long time people became complacent,” Dr Paul Griffin, an associate professor and infectious disease physician at the University of Queensland, said. “The risk-perception was relatively low at the time,” he added, describing people’s lack of urgency to get vaccinated, thanks to the protection offered by rigid border controls.

Only “once people saw the virus circulating firsthand and saw the consequences” did a shift in vaccination uptake begin to change, Griffin said.

Vaccinations surge

Only a few months ago, Australia had the lowest fully vaccinated population in the OECD. As of the end of last week, the nation had risen eight places.

Leading the charge were the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria. Since July, the cumulative total doses administered in the three regions has surged in near-record time compared with other countries at similar times in their rollouts.

In NSW, 91.1% of people over the age of 16 had at least one dose by 14 October, and 76.5% had two. In Victoria, these figures stand at 86.7% and 61.5%.

A staggering 98% of people aged over 12 and living in Canberra, the capital, have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and 75.9% have had both. The city is on track to be the most Covid-vaccinated city in the world, and authorities estimate that by November almost all of the territory’s population will be fully vaccinated.

Nationally, 83.2% of Australians over 16 have had at least one dose, as of Wednesday, and 64.4% are fully vaccinated, according to the Australian government’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout report.

The speed of vaccination uptake allowed those in NSW to enjoy “freedom day” on Monday. Schools will reopen next week.

Setting vaccination targets at 70% and 80% for reopening certainly “incentivised people quite a bit”, Griffin said.

Vaccination rollouts have tended to slow as countries approached the 50% mark – this was particularly pronounced in the US, which vaccinated 1% of its population every day in April but has stalled since, with less than 56% having received two jabs. The UK also began to slow after hitting its peak in the 20-25% range, and took almost twice as long to go from 45-50% and 50-55% as it managed in its peak.

Australia has bucked this trend – but the country is divided. The states of Western Australia and Queensland have the lowest rates of vaccination because they have seen less circulation and impact from the virus. The states are still pursuing Covid-zero and their borders are closed to their neighbours in the south-east.

“The states that have been the most impacted [by the virus] have had the most successful rollouts,” Griffin said.

Dr Greg Dore, an infectious diseases physician and epidemiologist at Australia’s Kirby Institute of medical research, described the turnaround in vaccine rates as “in one word: phenomenal”.

“If you went back three or four months, nobody would have anticipated this level of coverage we have now,” he said.

Dore credited a mix of government initiatives as well as community leadership, bipartisan support and the urgency created by the Delta outbreak.

Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of NSW, said: “The Delta hotspots in Sydney demonstrated that partnership between the authorities and the community resulted in exceptional vaccination response.”

Dore said he was “very confident” Australia would soon find itself in the top 10 countries of vaccine coverage. “The outbreaks have absolutely jet-propelled vaccination uptakes” and “generated that urgency”."

Almost five years later a new world order has emerged, but it is not the one China’s president and others gathered in Davos that day seemed to have in mind.

Instead of a continuation of the post-cold war era of growth underpinned by free trade, the world faces a fractured economic system where the post-pandemic supply shock and mistrust bred by the virus pushes countries towards an autarkist impulse for self-sufficiency.

Autarky is a Greek word meaning “self-reliance” and was popularised as shorthand for economic nationalism in the 19th century. It gained some credence as an economic model when the young Soviet Union in effect shut itself off from world trade, and the nationalist impulse towards self-sufficiency appealed to Hitler. It also flourished in the postwar world, especially in Africa, though the creed of globalisation has left few examples outside North Korea.

There were already some signs of nationalist-driven challenges to the prevailing system exemplified by Brexit, the rise of Trump, and a growing suspicion that China was not prepared to play by the rules set by the US and its proxies.

The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated these trends, experts believe.

Evgeny Postnikov, a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Melbourne, says the pressures of the pandemic have delivered a stark realisation about how much countries rely on imports and products enmeshed in the global supply chain.

From the initial scramble to protect production of face masks in France, to the careful control of vaccine technology, the pandemic has thrown up countless examples of how quickly the existing world order began to buckle under the domino effect of nationalistic urges.

“Governments can’t be relying on strategic competitors to supply crucial goods and services,” Postnikov says. “Trade and security were seen differently but now both are treated as high politics. That is why autarkist push is not going away. If anything it will get stronger, and that is quite worrying.”

The power cuts across northern China in recent weeks have led Beijing to accelerate its drive to become more self-sufficient. After hopeful signs that China would wean itself off fossil fuels by shutting hundreds of coal-fired power stations, the hint this week from Beijing of a rethink on slashing emissions is a crushing blow to global cooperation on the climate crisis.

Under the “Made in China” policy launched in 2018, China is already trying to develop more capacity in semiconductors, the lifeblood of consumer goods ranging from Teslas to toasters, and PlayStations to printers, as well as other strategic products. The country’s belt and road initiative is binding dozens of nations in Asia, Africa and Europe into Beijing’s economic orbit.

India, which was slow to begin dumping its corporatist economic model in favour of a more global-facing one, has also given a name for its plan to head back in the opposite direction: Atmanirbhar Bharat. This translates as “self-reliant India” and is designed, in the words of the foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, to extricate the country from “global commitments not to our advantage”.

Hence India’s withdrawal last year from the pan-Asian Regional Comprehensive Economic Cooperation pact (Rcep) over concerns that its huge agricultural sector would be sacrificed on the altar of free trade.

In Britain the sudden loss of cheap migrant labour means employers are looking again at their business models. On Wednesday Britain’s “chicken king”, the head of the country’s largest poultry producer, called for a total rethink of how food is produced. “Three months ago I was vocal about the government needing to help with labour issues,” said Ranjit Singh Boparan, the owner of 2 Sisters Food Group, which processes 10 million chickens a week. “I’ve now come to the conclusion that in reality it can’t fix all the problems.”

He says he no longer believes the solution is more visas for foreign workers: instead, the price of food will have to rise in line with the cost of producing it.

“We need to work with our supply chains and customers to solve these issues. But it will come at a cost. I need to invest, increase automation and make our factories more welcoming for new recruits,” he said.

The supply shock has “thrown sand in the gears of the world economy”, according to George Magnus, an independent economist and associate at the China Centre, at Oxford University. “It is hard to disentangle structural issues around the supply chain with the process of globalisation. Everything is more complicated and more expensive. It looks like a symptom of a decomposing global economy.”

He says the world economy should begin to realign by next year but that the current crisis could have a “corrosive impact in the medium term” as companies seek to diversify from sole-source supply and secure strategically important products such as semiconductors, batteries and energy.

More than 80% of industries have experienced supply chain disruptions because of the pandemic, according to a report by the consultancy Deloitte, and about 75% of companies have brought forward plans to repatriate manufacturing from overseas by building smart factories closer to home.

A study by the Reshoring Initiative, in the US, has forecast that the country will add 224,213 jobs from abroad in 2021, an increase of 38% on 2020. Investment in strategic products such as semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries and pharmaceuticals are driving the changes, the report says.

There are similar moves in the UK, where a report predicts factories could make almost £5bn more goods in 2021 as the pandemic and Brexit prompt businesses to bring home production.

The rising cost of labour in countries such as China have added pressure on corporations for a rethink of the way their products are made. For example, labour costs are now cheaper in Mexico than in China and short-circuiting the economic model of the latter as the workshop of the world while providing a powerful incentive for American producers to set up shop closer to home.

Another problem undermining the global system is that the controversy over the origins of coronavirus has poisoned relations already struggling with battles over tariffs, Hong Kong, and alleged Chinese infiltration of foreign communications networks through the state champion Huawei.

“The virus has bred mistrust,” says Magnus, “and the division sown by this has been a shock for China. It’s not going to be easy to make good because public attitudes in the west now show a high level of antagonism towards China. I don’t know what it would take to come back from that.”

Britain’s withdrawal from the EU was a shock to the world’s trading system, and when Trump took power days after that Xi speech at Davos one of his first acts was to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. It could be a sign of things to come as countries “decouple” from the globalised system.

“We’re not going to end up with lots of North Koreas – the autarkist state par excellence,” says Postnikov. “But what we will see I think is a world of smaller regional blocs where there are shorter supply chains. The TPP, Rcep, Brexit – it’s all unilateralist, whereas before these problems were viewed through a multilateral lens.”"

Victoria Cairns, 45, a headteacher from Derbyshire, was diving in Bali in 2008 when she saw one of the island’s famous turtles. It loomed towards her in the crystal clear water, and she was delighted – until she saw the plastic bag in its mouth. “I just thought: ‘Oh God, we are parasites’,” Cairns remembers. “Humans are at the top of the food chain and we’re having a devastating impact on the environment.”

She set up anti-litter Instagram account, @plastic_reduction, to raise awareness of the damage caused by plastic pollution. She regularly litter-picks around her neighbourhood. “She’s done amazing work keeping the area clean, tidy and beautiful,” says friend and fellow litter-picker Laura Clifton, who co-runs @plastic_reduction.

Cairns estimates she has spent around 12 hours a month for the past three years litter-picking. She keeps a litter-picker in the boot of her car, and will frequently pull over on the way back from work to clean something up. When running, Cairns carries a portable litter-picker in her backpack, and picks up rubbish on her cool-down walk. “Sometimes I pick a particular stretch of road and do it as a project. It might take 10 or 15 sessions, and I’ll keep coming back until it’s cleared.”

The amount of rubbish littering Britain’s streets is horrifying. Packaging from the fast food giants is the biggest problem, she says. Then there are the truly grim finds. “I’ve found water bottles someone has urinated in,” says Cairns. “And condoms.”

She never catches people littering. “This makes me cross,” she says. “It means they are doing it when people aren’t looking, as they know it’s unacceptable.”

Cairns litter-picks because she loves the sea. She always has. She grew up in Ponteland, near the sandy beaches of the Northumberland coast. “All my childhood pictures are of me in my little pigtails, a frilly bathing suit, in the sea.” After graduating from university she visited the Great Barrier Reef, where she tried diving for the first time.

“I was staggered by the beauty,” she says. She remembers Christmas tree worms blooming on the coral reef like corsages on a prom dress, lampshade-shaped jellyfish, scuttling crabs and the majestic sweep of a shark fin.

When she is underwater, Cairns has a feeling of complete calm. “You are very present,” she says. “There’s no distraction. The sound is so different. You don’t have to paddle or move your fins; you can just look around. It is just beauty, everywhere.”

She has dived in Thailand, Australia and Bali. “It is a luxury,” she admits, and during Covid she has missed travel sorely. But over the years she has seen the beaches of these idylls overflow with plastic. “There are times of the year in Bali where there is trash everywhere. The tourists call it trash season. You’d be on the beach but the litter wasn’t from Bali; it had come from elsewhere.”

Cairns hates what this says about capitalist culture. “We are by nature greedy overconsumers: we have a huge amount of waste products, and we don’t value things. There’s no value in a plastic bag, so we chuck it away. But every piece of plastic you put in the bin is sitting in the earth somewhere. (It might be buried, or burned, or floating in the ocean, or on the side of a road. But it’s not going anywhere.)”

When she collects plastic bottles and carrier bags, it feels like a small act of care: this bag will not end up in a turtle’s mouth. It is an infinitesimally small act in the scheme of things, but it’s something.

Cairns balked at the prospect of me doing anything nice for her. But then she realised what could be helpful: a paddleboard, so she can litter-pick along the waterways near her house. UK-based carbon-negative brand The Paddle Co volunteered to provide Cairns with one of its boards.

“It landed on the last day of school,” she says gleefully, when I catch up with her after her two-week holiday in Pembrokeshire. “Perfect!” She went paddleboarding in the Irish sea, where there was – thankfully – no litter to be seen. Since coming home, Cairns has been litter-picking in the canal near her house. “It’s so beautiful,” she says. “You get a different perspective being on the water.”

In a year with no scuba diving, the paddleboard is a good substitute. “It’s such a treat, really. I haven’t been able to get under the sea recently, so it’s lovely to be on it. It gives you peace.”

This summer he sampled one of the first batches in the world produced from cell cultures rather than coffee beans.

“To describe it is difficult but, for me, it was in between a coffee and a black tea,” said Rischer, head of plant biotechnology at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, which developed the coffee. “It depends really on the roasting grade, and this was a bit of a lighter roast, so it had a little bit more of a tea-like sensation.”

Rischer couldn’t swallow the coffee, as this cellular agriculture innovation is not yet approved for public consumption. Instead, he swirled the liquid around in his mouth and spit it out. He predicts that VTT’s lab-grown coffee could get regulatory approval in Europe and the US in about four years’ time, paving the way for a commercialized product that could have a much lower climate impact than conventional coffee.

The coffee industry is both a contributor to the climate crisis and very vulnerable to its effects. Rising demand for coffee has been linked to deforestation in developing nations, damaging biodiversity and releasing carbon emissions. At the same time, coffee producers are struggling with the impacts of more extreme weather, from frosts to droughts. It’s estimated that half of the land used to grow coffee could be unproductive by 2050 due to the climate crisis.

In response to the industry’s challenges, companies and scientists are trying to develop and commercialize coffee made without coffee beans.

VTT’s coffee is grown by floating cell cultures in bioreactors filled with a nutrient. The process requires no pesticides and has a much lower water footprint, said Rischer, and because the coffee can be produced in local markets, it cuts transport emissions. The company is working on a life cycle analysis of the process. “Once we have those figures, we will be able to show that the environmental impact will be much lower than what we have with conventional cultivation,” Rischer said.

American startups are also working on beanless coffee. In September, Seattle-based Atomo Coffee released what it called the world’s first “molecular coffee” in a one-day online pop-up, charging $5.99 a can.

The startup, which has raised $11.5m, makes its coffee by converting the compounds from plant waste into the same compounds contained in green coffee. Ingredients, including date seed extracts, chicory root, grape skin as well as caffeine, are roasted, ground and brewed. This method results in 93% lower carbon emissions and 94% less water use than conventional coffee production, as well as no deforestation, according to Atomo.

“The industry has known about the deleterious effects of coffee farming for a long time, whether we’re talking deforestation or major water usage,” said Atomo’s co-founder Jarret Stopforth. “[Before starting Atomo] I was thinking to myself, ‘There’s got to be a better way to do this.’”

Atomo’s facility can produce about 1,000 servings of coffee a day. The goal is to increase that to 10,000 servings a day over the next 12 months, said Stopforth, and in two years to move into a facility that can produce 30m servings of coffee a year. Stopforth says that Atomo will start the initial phase of the new factory build within the next three months.

Alternative coffee companies like Atomo not only have the potential to help tackle the climate crisis but to benefit the industry generally, said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Take arabica beans, said Charlebois. “You need specific climatic patterns, and it’s much better if you’re more in control in a laboratory environment than just trying to rely on Mother Nature.” Technology can help stabilize production and make it more predictable, he said.

But it’s unclear how many people would be willing to give up conventional coffee for one of its beanless counterparts. A 2019 survey by Dalhousie University found that 72% of Canadians say they would not drink lab-grown coffee.

Maricel Saenz, founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Compound Foods said she was working to “reinvent” coffee and to show people why doing so matters. Compound Foods, which has secured $4.5m in seed funding, says it recreates coffee farm production in the lab. The startup uses microbes and fermentation technology to grow a variety of flavors and aromas, Saenz said.

Preliminary results from a carbon life cycle analysis indicate that the company’s coffee produces a tenth of the greenhouse gas emissions and water use of traditional coffee, Saenz said. She plans to introduce her product by late 2022 and expects pricing to be similar to specialty coffees. “As we improve our processes, we aim to decrease our prices,” she said.

As the population grows and pressure increases on natural resources, Saenz said, “we need to be producing food in more efficient ways, using a lot of the biotechnology and fermentation tools that are now at our disposal.”

But Daniele Giovannucci, president and co-founder of the Committee on Sustainability Assessment, a consortium that focuses on agricultural sustainability, is concerned that scaling up lab-grown coffee could affect the livelihoods of the millions of workers in the traditional coffee industry, especially in countries such as Ethiopia where coffee is central to the economy. “What’s going to happen to all these people?” Giovannucci asked. “What are they going to do, because this is a key cash crop?”

There’s a risk, he said, that lab-grown coffee could create significant socio-economic problems that could drive even greater climate change effects. “It is not clear if, in the end, its net effect may worsen global sustainability, along with many millions of lives.”

Saenz, who is from Costa Rica, a coffee-exporting country, said, “I know many coffee producers, so it’s something that I definitely worry about.” But, she added, “the number one threat that coffee farmers have today is climate change” – whether that’s heat that disrupts ripening times, or unexpected frosts as Brazil experienced in the summer, which severely damaged crops.

Saenz said her company will collaborate with non-profits to support small coffee farmers transitioning to more sustainable agricultural practices, including providing training and crop insurance.

While lab-grown coffee shows real promise, said Charlebois, the politics should not be underestimated, especially as so many farmers depend on conventional methods of producing crops and many of them live in developing economies. “Scalability is not an issue for lab-grown coffee,” he said, “but regulations and general acceptance of the technology will be greater challenges.”"

It was a Diana Bride doll, ordered by my mother from a catalogue, although with her rictus smile and huge helmet of hair she looked more like Nancy Reagan. The details didn’t matter: she had the vague outlines of princess – big glittery jewels, big glittery eyes – so I could project whatever I wanted on to her, and I did; I played with her so much I snapped off her right foot.

This is a true story, but if the metaphor within it feels too heavy-handed, then I would advise you to keep clear of the many films and TV shows about Diana, none of which shy away from the obvious metaphorical nudge and shove. In his eulogy for his sister at her funeral in 1997, Earl Spencer described her as “the most hunted person of the modern age”. Screenwriters since have taken that description and run pell-mell with it: in the last season of The Crown, she was a beautiful stag; in Spencer – the new film by Pablo Larraín, starring Kristen Stewart as Diana – she is a pheasant, “beautiful but not very bright”, as she sighs sadly. Both the stag and pheasant are, of course, hunted by the evil Windsors, because that has been the narrative around Diana ever since her death, even though not even the Daily Express still believes they actually killed her.

Ever since the Windsors saw in young Diana Spencer the vague outlines of a princess, the world has projected on to her whatever it wanted. An unworldly and barely educated Sloane who was married off at 20, she offered a conveniently blank canvas in her lifetime and even more of one afterwards. Was she a saint or a manipulator, a schemer or an airhead? Does the story of Diana tell us something about the royals? Women? Celebrity? Britain? Pick and choose, folks!

Back in the 80s, when Diana first became a public figure, that other great no-surname-necessary female celebrity, Madonna, was explicitly comparing herself to Marilyn Monroe, but she always had too much personality, confidence and autonomy to fill that role credibly. As Elton John realised when he quickly repurposed his song Candle in the Wind for her funeral, Diana was the real Monroe of the second half of the 20th century: photographed so frequently she seemed more like an image than a person, and she learned to exploit her own appearance as much as the media did. Then suddenly, that perennial little girl lost was lost for good, in a plot twist even her step-grandmother, Barbara Cartland, would have rejected as too OTT. Like Monroe, Diana was only 36 when she died.

Genevieve O’Reilly has a tough job here, conveying a brilliant, selfless saint who just happens to be spending the summer on a yacht

That quality of vagueness around Diana makes her a tempting subject for a certain kind of film-maker, but it also makes her impossible for an actor to capture. I am a great fan of camp absurdity, so years before Naomi Watts simpered her way through the widely panned 2013 film Diana, I watched the 2007 US television movie, Diana: Last Days of a Princess. Now, Diana: Last Days of a Princess requires several leaps of belief, not least of which is its entire plot, predicated on the idea that Diana and Dodi Fayed was the great love affair of the 20th century.

Patrick Baladi – best known as Neil from The Office – is, even less credibly, cast as Fayed, presumably in an attempt to make the never wildly appealing Dodi somewhat sympathetic. Yet it is Genevieve O’Reilly who really has the tough job here, having to thread the needle of conveying a brilliant, selfless, caring saint who just happens to be spending the summer on the Fayed yacht. Screenwriters love to talk about how much they like to write “complicated women”, by which they mean a female character who sometimes gets a bit cross and maybe doesn’t always have blow-dried hair. They don’t mean a woman who is caring and manipulative, kind and shallow. Such women – as the Windsors discovered to their eternal misfortune – are just too much for some to handle.

Diana’s blankness means film-makers can do what they like with her life, so in the past 12 months, it has been rendered as a musical (Netflix’s Diana: The Musical, starring Jeanna de Waal), a gothic fable (Spencer) and a traditional biopic (The Crown, whose most recent series starred Emma Corrin as a younger Diana, with Elizabeth Debicki taking over for next year’s fifth outing). I haven’t seen Debicki’s portrayal yet, but it is to Corrin’s enormous credit that her naturalistic portrayal of Diana in the previous series never seemed ridiculous. Because, really, the further we get from Diana, the more tragically ridiculous her life seems. How else to tell the story of this young girl dragooned into an absurd family, which is then almost undone by her, other than as camp or horror? Never has The Crown’s slow-paced, minutely detailed format seemed more fortuitous than in its telling of Diana; whereas the Queen doesn’t change, really, from her teenage years to grandmotherhood, Diana’s shift from childlike virgin to vengeful shagger of the Hurlingham Club makes a lot more sense in a story that doesn’t try to capture her life in 90 minutes.

How can anyone make a musical about Diana and not include a song in which the future king is recorded wishing he was a tampon?

But The Crown fudges the truth in suggesting that Diana was bewildered by life in the palace, because, really, she was a normal person, as proved by her fondness for Duran Duran. So we are encouraged to imagine how we, fellow normal people, would have felt if we were living in Buckingham Palace and assume that’s how she felt, too. Of course, it is precisely because Diana, the daughter of an earl, was nothing like any of us that she was deemed suitable to marry Prince Charles. The one part of royal life that would have been unfamiliar to her was celebrity, and that was the one part she liked. It is fair to suggest, as The Crown does, that Diana needed love from the crowds because Charles denied her any; it’s equally fair to suspect that Diana also just really liked attention. But the latter doesn’t fit within the perennial good (Diana) v bad (the royals) narratives around this saga.

These black-and-white outlines make Diana’s life more suited to a musical, so Diana: The Musical is something of a heartbreaking missed opportunity. Unlike apparently everyone else, I rather enjoyed its doggerel lyrics (“Darling I’m holding our son / So let me say jolly well done!”) because, let’s be honest, Diana was always more of an Andrew Lloyd Webber girl than a Stephen Sondheim devotee, so the form suits the subject. But as both The Crown and Spencer take pains to emphasise, her favourite musical was The Phantom of the Opera, and Diana: The Musical desperately needs some of that show’s camp and schlock. Instead, it is a weirdly straight faced, adoring show about a princess. Even the royals are treated with far more moderation than they deserve, with Charles coming across more like Hugh Grant than the cold-hearted manchild he seems to be. Seriously, how can anyone make a musical about Diana and not include a song in which the future king is recorded wishing he was a tampon?

Spencer has a lot going for it: it looks great and the premise is amusing, with Diana as a kind of Mrs Rochester figure being driven mad by her cold husband (Jack Farthing) and a cruel servant (Timothy Spall, nostrils constantly flared). For some reason, Stewart plays Diana as if she were permanently being interviewed by Martin Bashir, all furtive meaningful side-glances and pointed muttered asides. After two hours of this, she comes across as not so much mad as peevish.

It doesn’t help that she is constantly moaning to the servants about how hard done by she is, while they dress her, cook for her and clean for her. Not even the omnipresent menacing music by Jonny Greenwood can make being summoned for dinner seem quite as abusive as we’re apparently meant to find it. Check your privilege, Lady Di! Maybe it’s because Prince Harry has spent the past two years going on about his miserable life while still enjoying all the privileges that life has to offer, but the whole gilded cage shtick feels a lot less interesting than the prison that was, clearly, Diana and Charles’s actual marriage.

The story of Diana is now so well known it is verging on legend, and legends are only worth retelling if there is something new to say that has the unmistakable feel of truth. The Crown, with its judiciously loose approach to history, has, improbably, found plenty to say about this overtold story; Diana: The Musical has nothing to say beyond that someone called Diana once married a prince (not news). The one moment when Spencer really sang for me is – semi-spoiler – the scene in which Diana introduces her children to the joys of Mike and the Mechanics. It’s fun, it’s silly, it’s sweet, it’s shallow, it’s irresistible. It’s Diana.

Spencer is in cinemas from 5 November."

Best thing about Andrew?

He is very enthusiastic and easy to talk to.

Would you introduce him to your friends?

Sure, I don’t see why not.

Describe Andrew in three words?

Chatty, inquisitive, engaging.

What do you think he made of you?

Hopefully easy to talk to – and brave (I studied forensics and criminology at university). I didn’t have any romantic feelings for him, and towards the end of the date, I got the vibe that he didn’t think we were particularly compatible, either.

Did you go on somewhere?

No.

And … did you kiss?

No.

If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?



We would have been more compatible: we didn’t have a huge amount in common, and didn’t get much beyond small talk, which I’m not a fan of.

Marks out of 10?

8 – Andrew is a lovely guy and good company. However, there was no romantic spark.

Would you meet again?

Yes, if we ran into each other, but just as friends.

Andrew on Marta

What were you hoping for?

My friend Sheyda to be vindicated in suggesting I did this.

First impressions?

She was trying to prevent either of us stepping on broken glass when the photographer’s light fell at our feet.

What did you talk about?

Polish blood sausage, a postmortem Marta attended as a student, and how expensive it would be to feed her dog Charlie fresh entrails every day.

Any awkward moments?

A man on the next table was watching a horror film loudly on his laptop. The constant screams were a tad awkward.

Good table manners?

Flawless! Marta even used a knife and fork to dissect her prawn bao.

Best thing about Marta?

Her no-nonsense approach to life.

Would you introduce her to your friends?

Sure, my friends are the best thing about me.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/16/imperial-beach-california-exxon-mobil-climate-crisis,"['exxon', 'climate', 'oil', 'imperial', 'city', 'beach', 'citys', 'sued', 'went', 'dedina', 'evidence', 'mayor', 'industry', 'lawsuit', 'smalltown']","Serge Dedina is a surfer, environmentalist and mayor of Imperial Beach, a small working-class city on the California coast.

He is also, if the fossil fuel industry is to be believed, at the heart of a conspiracy to shake down big oil for hundreds of millions of dollars.

ExxonMobil and its allies have accused Dedina of colluding with other public officials across California to extort money from the fossil-fuel industry. Lawyers even searched his phone and computer for evidence he plotted with officials from Santa Cruz, a city located nearly 500 miles north of Imperial Beach.

The problem is, Dedina had never heard of a Santa Cruz conspiracy. Few people had.

“The only thing from Santa Cruz on my phone was videos of my kids surfing there,” Dedina said. “I love the fact that some lawyer in a really expensive suit, sitting in some horrible office trying to find evidence that we were in some kind of conspiracy with Santa Cruz, had to look at videos of my kids surfing.”

That’s where the laughter stopped.

The lawyers found no evidence to back up their claim. But that did not stop the industry from continuing to use its legal muscle to try to intimidate Dedina, who leads one of the poorest small cities in the region.

The mayor became a target after Imperial Beach filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and more than 30 other fossil-fuel companies demanding they pay the huge costs of defending the city from rising seas caused by the climate crisis.

Imperial Beach’s lawsuit alleges the oil giants committed fraud by covering up research showing that burning fossil fuels destroys the environment. The industry then lied about the evidence for climate change for decades, deliberately delaying efforts to curb carbon emissions.

The city’s lawsuit was among the first of a wave of litigation filed by two dozen municipalities and states across the US that could cost the fossil-fuel industry billions of dollars in compensation for the environmental devastation and the deception.

Dedina says his minority majority community of about 27,000 cannot begin to afford the tens of millions of dollars it will cost to keep at bay the waters bordering three sides of his financially strapped city. The worst of recent storms have turned Imperial Beach into an island.

One assessment calculated that, without expensive mitigation measures, rising sea levels will eventually swamp some of the city’s neighbourhoods, routinely flood its two schools and overwhelm its drainage system.

Imperial Beach’s annual budget is $20m. Exxon’s chief executive, Darren Woods, was paid more than $15m last year.

“We don’t have a pot to piss in in this city. So why not go after the oil companies?” he said. “The lawsuit is a pragmatic approach to making the people that caused sea level rise pay for the impacts it has on our city.”

That’s not how Exxon, the US’s largest oil company, saw it. Its lawyers noted that Imperial Beach filed its case in July 2017, at the same time as two California counties, Marin and San Mateo. The county and city of Santa Cruz followed six months later with similar suits seeking compensation to cope with increasing wildfires and drought caused by global heating.

Exxon alleged that the sudden burst of litigation, and the fact that the municipalities shared a law firm specialising in environmental cases, Sher Edling, was evidence of collusion.

Exxon filed lawsuits claiming the municipalities conspired to extort money from the company by following a strategy developed during an environmental conference at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, 25 miles north of Imperial Beach, nine years ago.

The meeting, organised by the Climate Accountability Institute and the Union of Concerned Scientists, produced a report outlining how legal strategies used by US states against the tobacco industry in the 1990s could be applied to cases against fossil fuel companies.

Dedina was also targeted by one of the US’s biggest business groups at the forefront of industry resistance to increased regulation to reduce greenhouse gases, the National Association of Manufacturers, and a rightwing thinktank, the Energy & Environment Legal Institute.

The manufacturing trade group was behind the efforts to obtain data from Dedina’s phone and documents in 2018. In its public disclosure request to the mayor’s office, NAM called Imperial Beach’s lawsuit “litigation based on political or ideological objections more appropriately addressed through the political process”.

Exxon is attempting to use a Texas law that allows corporations to go on a fishing expedition for incriminating evidence by questioning individuals under oath even before any legal action is filed against them. The company is trying to force Dedina, two other members of Imperial Beach’s government, and officials from other jurisdictions, to submit to questioning on the grounds they were joined in a conspiracy against the oil industry.

“A collection of special interests and opportunistic politicians are abusing law enforcement authority and legal process to impose their viewpoint on climate change,” the oil firm claimed. “ExxonMobil finds itself directly in that conspiracy’s crosshairs.”

A Texas district judge approved the request to depose Dedina, but then a court of appeals overturned the decision last year. The state supreme court is considering whether to take up the case.

The target on Dedina is part of a wider pattern of retaliation against those suing Exxon and other oil companies.

In an unusual move in 2016, Exxon persuaded a Texas judge to order the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, to travel to Dallas to be deposed about her motives for investigating the company for alleged fraud for suppressing evidence on climate change. The judge also ordered that New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, be “available” in Dallas on the same day in case Exxon wanted to question him about a similar investigation.

Healey accused Exxon of trying to “squash the prerogative of state attorneys general to do their jobs”. The judge reversed the deposition order a month later and Healey filed a lawsuit against the company in 2019, which is still awaiting trial.

But similar tactics persuaded the US Virgin Islands attorney general to shut down his investigation of the oil giant.

Patrick Parenteau, a law professor and former director of the Environmental Law Center at Vermont law school, said the attempt to question Dedina and other officials is part of a broader strategy by the oil industry to counter lawsuits with its own litigation.

“These cases are frivolous and vexatious. Intimidation is the goal. Just making it cost a lot and be painful to take on Exxon. They think that if they make the case painful enough, Imperial Beach will quit,” he said.

If the intent is to kill off the litigation against the oil industry, it’s not working. Officials from other municipalities have called Exxon’s move “repugnant”, “a sham” and “outrageous”, and have vowed to press on with their lawsuits.

Dedina described the action as a “bullying tactic” by the oil industry to avoid accountability.

“The only conspiracy is [that] a bunch of suits and fossil-fuel companies decided to pollute the earth and make climate change worse, and then lie about it,” he said. “They make more money than our entire city has in a year.”

The city’s lawsuit claims it faces a “significant and dangerous sea-level rise” through the rest of this century that threatens its existence. Imperial Beach commissioned an analysis of its vulnerability to rising sea levels which concluded that nearly 700 homes and businesses were threatened at a cost of more than $100m. It said that flooding will hit about 40% of the city’s roads, including some that will be under water for long periods. Two elementary schools will have to be moved. The city’s beach, regarded as one of the best sites for surfing on the California coast, is being eroded by about a foot a year.

Imperial Beach sits at the southern end of San Diego bay. Under one worst-case scenario, the bay could merge with the Tijuana River estuary to the south and permanently submerge much of the city’s housing and roads.

The city has received some help with creating natural climate barriers. The Fish and Wildlife Service restored 400 acres of wetland next to the city as a national wildlife refuge which also acts as a barrier to flooding, and is expected to restore other wetlands together with the Port of San Diego. A grant is paying for improved equipment to warn of floods.

But that still leaves the huge costs of building new schools and drainage systems, and adapting other infrastructure. Dedina said that without the oil companies stumping up, it won’t happen.

“People ask, how did you go against the world’s largest fossil fuel companies? Isn’t that scary? No. What’s scary is coastal flooding and the idea that whole cities would be under water,” said the mayor.

“Honestly, bring it on. I can’t wait to make our case. I can’t wait to take the fight to them because we have nothing to lose.”

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/oct/16/living-with-huntingtons-disease-for-our-family-the-end-of-days-is-always-close-at-hand,"['wanted', 'hand', 'days', 'anna', 'disease', 'day', 'didnt', 'id', 'living', 'way', 'things', 'end', 'tom', 'huntingtons', 'hd', 'close', 'family']","The day I found out how I was going to die began innocuously enough: the usual blur of nappy changing and tetchy texts to my husband. Life in our recently refurbished London home had settled into a rhythm, with a low-level background of domestic discontent. Arguments about wallpaper had run their course; our cats had made their peace with our one-year-old daughter, Anna; and I was pleased to have married a responsible hedonist who liked babies but never made me feel guilty for finding them boring.

That day, my husband, Tom, had gone to work early; a documentary director, he was filming a series about the London Underground. After a sleepless night, I was eating breakfast with Anna when the landline rang. It was my dad’s old friend Eric, who had been keeping an eye on him ever since my mum had died four years earlier. We were all worried because Murph (everyone called my dad Murph) had been making some bad decisions, then digging in defiantly.

Eric said there was something I should know: Murph had been diagnosed with Huntington’s disease (HD). I’d never heard of the condition and had no idea what it was. So of course I did the one thing you should never do: I Googled it. Wikipedia made it sound a bit like Alzheimer’s and a bit like Parkinson’s, but worse than both. It was a degenerative neurological condition and it sounded terrible; poor Murph. Though it made sense, given some of the things I’d noticed about him since my mother died. He was twitchy and fidgety, and there was a kind of hesitancy to his once-confident stride.

Then there was a bit about genetics. In dry Wiki-speak, “HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The probability of each offspring inheriting an affected gene is 50%.” All the things that would happen to my dad might also happen to me or my brother. And if I had the gene, my children would be at risk, too. Unlike Alzheimer’s, HD typically manifests in midlife, between the ages of 35 and 45. I was 35.

The first visible sign is the chorea – jerky, uncontrollable, involuntary movements in all parts of the body. As parts of the brain degenerate, patients suffer severe cognitive problems: loss of memory, of judgment, of the capacity to organise oneself. They find walking difficult and are prone to falls. They lose the capacity to swallow and sometimes die of malnutrition. Their personality is often affected, too. Reports of aggressive, compulsive and sexually inappropriate behaviour are common. Towards the end, families often see no other option than to have their suffering relatives institutionalised. There is no cure for Huntington’s disease.

I called Tom. It was about half past eight and he was on his way to film at Edgware Road station. I was in tears as I explained what Eric had told me and what I had read. As usual, he tried to calm me down, but for once his insistence that the internet was bound to be exaggerating the scale of the disaster was sadly misplaced.

Then the phone went dead. He had arrived at the station minutes after a bomb had been detonated on a train in the tunnel beneath. It was 7 July 2005, and for the rest of the day he was out of contact, caught up in the aftermath of the worst terror attack the capital had seen.

I turned on BBC News 24 and watched events unfold. I kept trying Tom’s phone but it was going straight to voicemail. I can’t remember many of the details of the day, but I do know how it felt. There was a sense that our lives had darkened around the edges. When Tom came back into range I was weeping with relief, but still unable to process the news that had blindsided us.

A mutual friend had introduced me to Tom at a party in Notting Hill in 2002. All the men in my life up to that point had been dysfunctional to varying degrees, but it was clear from the outset that Tom was both sane and interesting. Our first night together was a drunken laugh. There were no dating apps in those days – we just busked romance. It was hit and miss but more enjoyable for it. What would Tom have put on his profile? Would I have found his passion for Fulham football club off-putting? There was also his taste in clothes: I was a style fascist with an image to maintain, and wouldn’t normally have been seen dead with someone in Berghaus trousers.

My needs blotted out everyone else’s. I needed to be loved before the children, a tall order as I'd never been more unlovable

But when he was speaking, all the other people in the room faded to grey. It really was love at first chat. He even made football seem fascinating. I was pleased to see my self-limiting beliefs disappear between the sofa cushions. We had so much in common. His favourite song was my favourite, too: Another Girl, Another Planet by the Only Ones. At that point, the little areas of difference still seemed interesting rather than threatening.

We kissed on top of the coats in the spare room. We went back to my house, and in the morning I wanted a McDonald’s breakfast. We both had hangovers, but Tom set off up the high street in search of Egg McMuffins. He got lost on the way back. I was worried he wouldn’t return; there were a few anxious minutes of missing him. This little scene introduced all the major themes of our subsequent relationship. Tom was brought up to be dutiful; I was raised to be bossy and needy. Looking back, I wish I’d got dressed instead of lying there like the Queen of Sheba. We could have gone to McDonald’s together. What could have begun as a collaborative partnership was skewed in my favour from the start.

A few days later, I ran into a friend and told him I’d met the person I was going to marry. I’d never thought about marrying anyone before. Scrolling back through all my relationships, I could see that none of my exes would have made good fathers, even if they’d been the marrying kind. Once I’d decided this, I thought it would be only a matter of time before Tom was persuaded, by force of argument, that I was the right woman for him.

A year later, Tom and I were in Skye on a mini-break with a friend and her soon-to-be-ex-husband. We’d spent the whole weekend arguing. I was impatient for romantic avowals, or a full explanation of why he hadn’t proposed yet. Surely he knew everything about me now?

I had form when it came to demanding presents before they could be freely given. Murph always gave me money for my birthday, which is in September. Instead of waiting, I would ask him for it in August – or July. In Skye, I wanted Tom to advance his marriage proposal in exactly the same way. But my nagging had the opposite effect (no one likes to be chivvied) and we nearly split up. Things were looking dicey on the way home but then, in the baggage reclaim area, probably still feeling ambivalent about me, he produced a diamond he’d had on him the whole time. When we got in the car, we both felt cheated of the moment he had planned as a memory to cherish. But it was all my fault.

Now, 15 years after my diagnosis, I wonder whether this kind of unreasonable and ultimately self-defeating behaviour was a product of my upbringing, or of Huntington’s disease, or a combination of the two. It would be far easier to blame HD than myself, but I can’t help thinking that I wasn’t symptomatic when I was being horrible to Tom. I may have been prematurely unempathic as a result of the disease, but that’s no excuse for throwing your weight around.

We married in 2003, at the Old Ship hotel in Brighton. From the moment I booked the wedding planners to the last song of the party, the script was a bride-focused fantasy in which Tom was marginalised. We did agree Brighton would be the best setting and both liked the Old Ship. But that was the last decision we made together.

In the early days of our marriage, I was hypercritical about everything and everyone, including Tom’s friends and family. Having started out on the Modern Review, with Toby Young and Julie Burchill, I had become a newspaper columnist. But being paid to be horrible about people caused collateral damage to my relationships.

My opposition to him having a social life was argued on a case-by-case basis. Someone he’d met at university who became an internet entrepreneur was cast out on political grounds. Another friend wanted us to play parlour games at her 30th birthday, so I made Tom drive me home (I hate parlour games). His family played Consequences on Christmas Day, which I scorned (the only Christmas traditions in my family were drinking too much and watching TV). So I’d sit it out, tutting.

I didn’t want him to enjoy himself unless he was with me or in my milieu. When he did manage to prise himself away for an evening, I would text him compulsively. It was airless and oppressive. If we went out with his friends, I would dress to kill everyone in range.

We had plenty of space but I wanted to upsize. I found my idea of a for ever home on a lovely corner plot in a street with cherry blossom on the trees. While we were renovating it, I found out I was pregnant with Anna.

Someone once described HD as an illness of mourning, which seems very apt. You lose your identity, and some of your humanity, while remaining aware enough to keep a tally of every loss. After I found out about Murph, I decided to take a test to find out whether I had the gene. I had assumed most in my position would choose to do the same, so I was surprised to learn 95% of them don’t. To me, wanting to take the test was the rational response, avoiding it the cowardly cop-out.

When I found out I did have the HD gene, what was there to do but cry? Even stoical Tom looked stricken.

For me, it started with small, unexplained absences: car keys, glasses, a million lighters, shoes, clothes. Then I lost the world, city by city. Familiar places became a scary tangle of streets, so I stayed in the house. Then the car itself started to go missing: when we stopped at services, I could never find my way back to it. Bigger human losses followed. I lost my sexuality. Friends stopped remembering to visit me. And then I began to lose my own past: as my short- and long-term memory were affected by HD, the story of my life receded into the distance and became increasingly inaccessible to me.

Before all those losses, I was living as fully as one could with the prospect of total identity collapse. Our son, John, was born on a lovely day in April 2009, three years after I tested positive and before the onset of my symptoms. It took us a long time to decide whether to have another child, knowing they would have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene mutation. But ultimately I didn’t want Anna to be an only child, coping with weird me and having no one to play with.

My therapist kept crying when I told her about life with HD, but I didn’t. Forgiveness and self-acceptance seemed elusive

People with Huntington’s disease may sometimes seem uncaring and thoughtless. Their apparent disregard for the emotional needs of a partner can be hurtful, especially when it contrasts with a formerly loving relationship; the natural tendency is for the partner to feel slighted. In these situations, the person with HD is not being deliberately awkward, wilful or unkind – their apparent self-centredness is a consequence of the loss of mental flexibility associated with the disease. They may no longer be able to put themselves in another’s shoes or weigh up both sides of an argument. They may genuinely fail to see how their actions affect others.

My various impairments kept our household from running smoothly until we found a carer, Ade. She also helped with admin and my to-do list. But empathy can’t be outsourced; my family needed a mother who could connect with them, and I was often too self-absorbed. Tom parented for the two of us (as well as earning all the money). He remembered their PE kit, involved them in creative activities such as baking so they didn’t sit in front of the telly all day, controlled their texting and took Anna to football. More importantly, he was there for them emotionally when I was semi-detached. I couldn’t be trusted with their weekly schedule; I even forgot John’s Christmas show. (“You were the only mummy who wasn’t there. The only mummy!”)

If I felt guilty, there must be hope for me. Could I have spent so long brooding about my inhumanity if I really was inhumane? I’ve read accounts of HD sufferers who feel no shame about behaving inappropriately or splashing out on cars they can’t afford, whereas I am constantly racked with guilt about ill-advised purchases and being a shit parent. I welcome this in, as a sign of life.

Tom has good reason to believe I was prematurely unempathic. Our relationship wasn’t loving or collaborative in the first place, so there were few reserves of goodwill to draw on when HD came to call.

Fast-forward a couple of years and I was finishing the milk before the others could get to it and sending Tom to the shop for more – every day. I never slept and made sure no one else did. My needs blotted out everyone else’s, and when I wanted something I had to have it now. I needed to be fed, loved and listened to before the children, which was a tall order as I had never been more unlovable.

My lack of empathy delivered a mortal blow to my marriage. The day before one of Tom’s work trips was always a blur of activity, so it didn’t seem all that surprising when, one morning in 2014, he took all the rubbish from our junkyard of a garden to the dump in a hired van. He had fixed the drains, called the gas people about the leak, taken John to his trapeze lesson, mowed the lawn, batch-cooked for the week, hung up all the washing and made daily to-do lists so none of us could forget anything while he was away. After a few days it occurred to me that this may have been a dress rehearsal for when he left for good, and so it proved.

We agreed to live apart. Tom deserved a second chance to be intimate with someone still capable of intimacy. It wasn’t just that, though: as well as desexualising me, HD has blunted my emotions. Tom promised he would make sure I had enough support, and he has been true to his word, but having people around to help with the practicalities and keep me company in the evenings is not the same as having a husband.

We made a plan for how we were going to tell the children we were separating, but I ended up ignoring it – I’d always tried to be straightforward with them and felt I needed to account for the fact that I was gloomier than usual. Anna barely looked up from her phone: “It was pretty obvious, Mum.” She said she wanted to live with me and seemed pleased that Tom and I were getting on, unlike her best friend’s divorced parents who couldn’t be in the same room as each other.

John is very sensitive, so I was sad but not surprised when he told me how affected he had been by our rows: “You thought I was upstairs when you were shouting at Dad, but I was outside the door.” Then, on our way back from school one day, he said, “If you and Dad divorced, it would mean a Huntington’s lady would be on her own.” Anna and I reassured him that Tom would always look after me even if we were no longer living together, but of course he was still worried.

As for me, I was heartbroken and at times indignant. How the hell could he leave me? Deep down, though, I realised if I’d treated him better before I got ill, we’d still have been together. He may only have stuck with me for as long as he did because he’d been raised to be dutiful to the point of self-abasement – if it hadn’t been for the HD, he would probably have left me years ago.

Tom moved into a flat around the corner; confusingly, we had never got on better. He said letting him go had been an act of love that would be an inspiration for Anna and John in years to come. But it was always horrible when he went home to his flat. I couldn’t stand the idea of him being with someone else, not least because they would have had to be unusually intelligent and empathic to get their heads around our unconventional setup – a woman of substance, who felt like competition when I contemplated her. Then I started to get used to it. The only thing to do is to accept the new normal.

I wish I’d nurtured him when I had the chance, but it’s too late for regret. I don’t want to feel burdened with guilt about the times I forgot his birthday, and can see only one way of avoiding this: remember it from now on. I want to celebrate the good things we still have.

John empathises with me, picking things up when I drop them (although, sadly, he must still be paid to embark on any household chore that takes longer than three minutes). Anna and Tom, and even Tom’s family, empathise with me, offering constant reassurance that none of this is my fault. Somehow, though, I can’t now seem to empathise with myself. My therapist kept crying when I told her about the end of my marriage and the daily frustrations of life with HD, but I didn’t. I could see that it was right to work on surmounting my guilt, but forgiveness and self-acceptance seemed elusive.

When things settled down, I started to think I hadn’t done such a bad job, given the hand I’d been dealt. I helped to look after my family and kept it on an even keel in demanding circumstances without moaning or longing to be back at the top of the bill. I found this unexpectedly rewarding and did not experience motherhood as a demotion, as I might once have done. I started writing a book in the study next to the kitchen, and discovered I didn’t really mind the noise of the children coming in and out with their friends, after all.

My HD has marched on, and my relationships are reconfigured. After four years of separation, the divorce papers were served. If I had been in a better mood, a celebration might have been in order. On my birthday Tom said what a great mother he thought I was and that Anna has blossomed into an intellectually rigorous and empathic teenager who we are all proud of. John has developed a love for performing arts and goes to a dance school, navigating public transport every day on his own. On the way home, he texts me to ask how my day was, and there are lots of small check-in moments like this where I sense his presence. I sometimes wonder if his anxiety has anything to do with the fact that he was made aware of my mortality – and his own – at such a young age. For our family, the end of days is always close at hand. Anna wants to be tested for the gene when she is old enough, but I have reassured them both that, by that time, drugs will be available that treat the illness and not just the symptoms. The children’s love has enveloped me with positivity, which I couldn’t have done without. Meanwhile, the book went to full term, and this writing project has led to a transformation of my fortune. I was an onlooker to other people’s lives for longer than I’d hoped, watching parties happen around me. Now, finally, I am the author of my own destiny.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/16/uk-announces-extra-29m-of-humanitarian-aid-for-ethiopia,"['announces', 'uks', 'ethiopia', 'humanitarian', 'rights', 'minister', 'conflict', 'extra', 'tigray', 'northern', '29m', 'aid', 'human', 'uk']","The UK has announced an extra £29m of humanitarian aid to people affected by the deepening conflict in northern Ethiopia, as the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reviews what kind of further pressure can be placed on the new Ethiopian government to open up badly needed humanitarian corridors.

The UK has provided more than £75m to alleviate the risk of famine – making it the second largest aid donor to Ethiopia – but officials acknowledge the de facto government blockade of Tigray is deepening the crisis.

The UK’s special envoy for famine prevention and humanitarian affairs, Nick Dyer, has just visited the Tigray capital of Mekelle and came away struck by the extent to which the food, water and energy crisis was worsening.

The UN has estimated Tigray needs 500 trucks of critical assistance each week, but less than 10% of this has been met since June. The shortfall is due to a lack of fuel, trucks and assurances about safe passage for truck drivers who have been subject to harassment and demands to pay bribes by the Ethiopian government.

The UN estimates 5.5 million people face acute food insecurity, including 400,000 people in northern Ethiopia facing famine-like conditions – more than in all of the humanitarian crises in the rest of the world combined. The UK government is convinced that this is entirely a human-made crisis caused by the territorial and sovereignty conflict.

Dyer said: “On my third visit to Ethiopia since the start of the Tigray conflict, I saw a further deterioration of the crisis and the conditions for humanitarian operations. The conflict in northern Ethiopia has spread beyond the borders of Tigray now, so we are expanding UK funding to reach those in urgent need in Afar and Amhara.”

An African Union initiative to install a ceasefire is making little progress, with Tigray forces refusing to engage, due partly to scepticism about the neutrality of the Nigerian-led mediation. UK diplomatic sources have for months been pressing the government in Addis Ababa to allow aid into the region, but have been told that a response was not possible until the new government was installed, something that happened this week.

Muferiat Kamil, the powerful minister for peace, was demoted in a reshuffle after three years in office, but it is not yet clear if that presages a change in policy. The prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, once a poster child for development in Africa, has not suffered politically by adopting a tough line against those in Tigray claiming independence but he is under growing international pressure.

In September, the US president, Joe Biden, issued an executive order that allows for sanctions on parties “complicit in prolonging” the conflict in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region. The US could remove Ethiopia’s privileges under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a move that could hit the country’s economy severely. Ethiopia says the deal is worth £237m annually.

The UN human rights office is due to publish a report into human rights abuses on 1 November, which could lead to further international sanctions.

The Tigray People’s Liberation Front pushed into the neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions in July, a move it said was intended to stop government forces from regrouping and break what it calls a humanitarian siege of Tigray.

The funding will be delivered by UN agencies and NGOs, including the World Food Programme, Unicef, and the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund. Lifesaving nutrition treatment is expected to be delivered for more than 100,000 malnourished children, and 27,000 pregnant and new mothers.

The UK’s ambassador for human rights, Rita French, raised the urgent need for unfettered humanitarian access at the Human Rights Council earlier this month and the former foreign secretary raised the UK’s concerns over the conflict in a call with prime minister Abiy in August."
https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/12/corporate-accountability-review-complicity-in-argentinian-state-terror-exposed,"['workers', 'state', 'review', 'accountability', 'company', 'torture', 'dictatorship', 'military', 'rights', 'argentinian', 'way', 'terror', 'victims', 'scale', 'exposed', 'collaboration', 'corporate']","Jonathan Perel has made a stealthily powerful one-man documentary about corporate involvement in human rights atrocities during Argentina’s military dictatorship after the 1976 coup. It’s an account of how companies assisted in state terror: the kidnap, torture and murder of employees considered subversive, mostly trade unionists or political activists.

Perel’s approach is startlingly – almost maddeningly – plain. Like a private detective, he parks his car outside 25 companies exposed by a 2005 government report about corporate accountability and the repression of workers during the regime. Over the footage he films from his car documenting the mundane comings and goings outside the buildings today, Perel calmly reads extracts from the report’s case studies.

Each study begins the same way, with a number: how many workers at the company were murdered, “disappeared” or arrested. The pattern is strikingly familiar: bosses identified undesirable employees who were then arrested at work or at home. Some survivors testified to being interrogated by military personnel holding their company file. Victims were often tortured on company premises or driven off to detention centres in company vehicles. Some businesses benefited during the dictatorship by having their private debt transferred to the state, or increased their profits by repressing the workforce.

There is nothing remotely graphic here and no detail about what happened to the victims. Nothing about the disappearances on “death flights”, where people were pushed alive from military planes above the Rio de la Plata and the Atlantic Ocean. The film’s meditative style is slow and patience-testing: no explainers or background information about the coup or dictatorship. But Perel’s surveillance footage becomes increasingly sinister, and the repetition is gripping in its way. You begin to wonder at the scale of this, how it’s possible that so many people were capable of actively participating in murder and torture on this scale; human rights groups put the total number killed at 30,000."

The British film-maker Sue Carpenter had come to Pokhara, a tourist city in central Nepal, to run a photography project with disadvantaged girls living in an institution. One of those girls was Belmaya.

“When I touched the camera for the first time I was like, ‘what is this box?’ I was so curious,” she says. “Sue taught me how to click pictures. I took hundreds of pictures. I loved it. I thought, I will have better life.”

Fifteen years later, the 29-year-old single mother is an award-winning film-maker, with a documentary she co-directed about her life released in cinemas and on-demand from Friday. I am Belmaya charts the past 14 years of Nepali’s life. It’s a story of poverty and struggle – but also second chances.

Nepali was born into a poor Dalit family (the lowest caste, formerly known as “untouchables”) in a remote village in western Nepal. As a Dalit girl, in a patriarchal country facing caste-based and sex discrimination, the odds were already stacked against her. But then both her parents died, when she was nine years old.

“We did not have enough food at home, and no money to buy books, so my brothers sent me to a girls’ home in Pokhara,” says Nepali.

It was there, in 2006, that she met Carpenter, who co-directed and produced I am Belmaya.

“Belmaya was 14 when we first met. She was one of 20 girls who participated in my photo project and absolutely loved taking photos,” says Carpenter. “She was different from the other girls, so feisty and vocal about injustice.”

But when Carpenter left the orphanage, Nepali’s life fell apart again.

“The behaviour of the orphanage owners was not good. They used to beat us and they did not let us use the camera after Sue left,” says Nepali.

When she was 18, with little education and very few job prospects, Nepali says she had no choice but to get married. She gave birth to a daughter a year later.

She discovered her husband was an abusive alcoholic. The family struggled for money and food.

“I had to clean and wash dishes, home to home, while coping as a new mother, just for survival,” she says. “Every night he used to come home drunk and beat me, then accused me, saying that my daughter is not from him. That hurt me a lot.

“Those days I often used to think what if I had not got married, and had been given a chance to learn more about cameras?”

Nepali says she felt hopeless.

Then, in 2014, Carpenter met Nepali again. Carpenter, by now a successful film-maker, had co-founded Asha Nepal, an organisation that supports trafficked girls and women in the country.

Carpenter began teaching Nepali about documentary film-making. The pair decided to capture Nepali’s life in front of, and behind, the camera. Their footage depicts her struggles for independence in a violent home, while also showing her growing love of film-making.

But her husband did not approve. “The journey to learning film-making was not easy for me. My husband used to accuse me of sleeping with another guy when I was out for training or shooting.

“One night my drunk husband started beating me, saying I am not allowed to use my camera and make films. I could have died that night if I had not called the police,” she says.

“However, I did not stop. I kept learning, I kept filming.” She left her husband three years ago.

Her perseverance resulted in her first short film, Educate Our Daughters, released in 2017, which highlighted the importance of girls’ education. The film won several awards and was selected for seven international film festivals.

“I could not say a word while receiving the award in London but back in my mind I was thinking of thousands of Nepali women like me who do not have any formal education, who got married early and were forced to give birth, then suffered domestic violence, inequality and discrimination,” says Nepali. “I wanted to tell this loudly.”

I Am Belmaya won best documentary at the UK Asian film festival, an award of excellence at the WRPN Women’s International film festival and was nominated for a One World Media award.

“This is not my last film and I’m not going to stop now. I will be making more films on the inequality, injustice and discrimination faced by Nepali women, I will be making more movies on the importance of education on empowerment,” says Nepali, who now lives with her nine-year-old daughter.

“My daughter studies in grade 3 now and I feel more proud seeing her going to school, where I did not get a chance, and I’m more proud being able to send her to school.

“My biggest achievement is I feel I’ve succeeded in making it to the heaven of film-making from the hell of poverty and abusive marriage.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/oct/15/un-quizzed-over-role-in-prison-like-island-camp-for-rohingya-refugees,"['reported', 'char', 'refugees', 'bangladesh', 'role', 'island', 'conditions', 'quizzed', 'camp', 'living', 'unhcr', 'bhasan', 'rohingya', 'prisonlike']","The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) is facing questions over whether it is helping to detain Rohingya refugees in prison-like conditions by providing services on a controversial island camp.

Over the past year, Bangladesh has relocated almost 20,000 refugees to Bhasan Char, an island formed of silt deposits in the Bay of Bengal thought to be vulnerable to cyclones, which the refugees are unable to leave.

About 700 refugees have reportedly attempted to flee the island but Bangladesh hopes that the UNHCR’s cooperation will ensure better services for the refugees and is now planning to increase the island’s population by 80,000 over the next three months.

Refugees International, a global advocacy organisation, said there were “serious questions” about whether it was safe and possible to move such numbers to the island from the Cox’s Bazar refugee camps, which are the world’s largest, hosting about 890,000 refugees.

“Most concerning is whether any relocations of Rohingya refugees to the island will be truly voluntary, evidenced by the fact that hundreds of refugees relocated there have already tried to flee,” said Daniel Sullivan, Refugees International’s senior advocate for human rights.

“As Refugees International has warned in the past, failure to properly assess conditions and inform refugees about the move will result in policies more akin to detention than refuge.”

The Geneva-based Global Detention Project tweeted: “In signing a new memorandum of understanding with the Bangladesh government, is the UNHCR assisting in the detention of Rohingya refugees on Bhasan Char island? Are refugees free to move on and off the island? Are they moving there truly voluntarily?”

Human Rights Watch reported in June that the government had misled refugees about conditions on the island and that some had been relocated without informed consent. It also reported that, despite promises from the government of good living conditions, they did not have access to work or education and were unable to leave.

In May, during a visit by senior UNHCR officials to inspect the island, thousands of refugees defied orders to remain in their shelters to protest at the living conditions. The UNHCR later said it was “deeply concerned” that refugees were injured during the protest.

A Rohingya teacher living in the Cox’s Bazar camps said they opposed the UNHCR’s cooperation with the government because they did not believe the island was fit to live on.

“There is not any freedom for the Rohingya people in Bhasan Char. People who have gone there thought life would be comfortable for them, as the government said they would be provided with everything they need,” said the teacher, who did not want to be named for fear of repercussions. “There is a lady in Bhasan Char – she sometimes talks with her mother and I heard from her mother that people in Bhasan Char are living as if in prison there.

“At least the government could consider free movement for the people who are in Bhasan Char, so they could travel to see their relatives.”

A leaked copy of the agreement offers no guarantee that refugees will be able to move freely to the mainland, Reuters reported on Friday.

Bangladesh has justified relocating refugees to the island by arguing that conditions are better than the overcrowded camps in Cox’s Bazar, which have witnessed devastating floods and fires this year.

The UN said, after the agreement with the government was announced last weekend, that its presence on Bhasan Char would “help support the refugees to lead decent lives on the island” by ensuring protection, education, healthcare and livelihoods.

Former UNHCR official Jeff Crisp questioned why the agreement between Bangladesh and UNHCR had not been published and whether it failed to ensure freedom of movement for the refugees, which could amount to it becoming a prison island.

He also questioned what the long-term plan was for the island, as little progress had been made towards ensuring the Rohingya can return safely to Myanmar, which several generations of refugees have fled after repeated military operations.

“I don’t know what strategy the Bangladeshi government is working on. What is the endgame? Do they assume people can live happily on Bhasan Char?” said Crisp. “They’re talking about 80,000 moving in the next three months. Are that number of people going to volunteer to go and, if they do, can you move that many people and give proper attention to settling them properly?”"

Kumar, who was working in the UK, was chosen by Reddy’s family. “But he didn’t take me to the UK after our marriage. He made excuses such as problems with the visa and so on,” says Reddy.

In 2016, Reddy became pregnant. Under pressure from the family, Kumar brought her to England. On arrival, she was shocked to discover Kumar’s secret. He had a British partner, two children and a stepchild. Neither Kumar’s nor Reddy’s families knew about the other family. Kumar threatened to leave Reddy if she told anyone.

Reddy is one of thousands of women who have faced abandonment by their husbands overseas.

Each year, thousands of men leave India to work abroad. The country has one of the largest diasporas – nearly 32 million Indians or people of Indian origin.

The man marries her, takes the dowry, and never returns Mamatha Raghuveer Achanta, Nila

Many return home to find a bride, as there is pressure to marry within the community. Some women and their families consider it prestigious to marry a nonresident Indian (NRI), believing they can provide opportunities for a better life overseas.

But for some, the dream of living happily ever after soon becomes a nightmare.

“In some cases, wives are abandoned in India: the man marries her, takes the dowry, and never returns. In others, the woman is taken overseas, abused and deserted,” says Mamatha Raghuveer Achanta, lawyer and founder of the Network of International Legal Activists (Nila). Based in Hyderabad, Nila has helped many Indian women deserted in the US, Canada, Australia, the UK and across Europe and countries in the Middle East.

The scale of overseas abandonment is unclear. But between 2015 and 2019, the Indian government says it dealt with more than 6,000 cases. Such were its concerns that it published a guidance booklet in 2019 on marriages to overseas Indians, which has chapters on precautions for brides and legal rights. Last year, a bill was approved, which, if enacted, will make it compulsory to register marriages with NRIs. Currently, there is no central law requiring marriages outside India to be registered, making it difficult to prove their validity.

The National Commission for Women says it received 2,846 complaints from women who had been abandoned between 2017 and 2021.

“Wife abandonment often goes hand in hand with domestic violence and dowry harassment,” says Swati Lakra, additional director general of police for women’s safety in Telangana state. Telangana, which has high emigration rates, has a special NRI police unit dealing with 208 cases. Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Kerala also have police departments to address wife abandonment.

Rita Saini*, 33, was abandoned by her husband last year. Married in India, Rita had been living with her husband, Nilesh Saini*, in Ireland for a number of years and the couple had a son. Last year, Nilesh suggested a trip back to India to meet some of his relatives. Rita was not working, so was financially dependent on her husband. After they had been in India for a few weeks, her husband flew back to Ireland without her knowledge. She and her son were left with her in-laws with no money and no way home.

From Ireland, Nilesh emailed her asking for a divorce. Rita has spent the past year trying to get help from different government departments in India and Ireland, but the pandemic has not helped, and she is without the financial means or legal support to pursue her case.

“I had read about these NRI marriage cases. I never thought it would happen to me. Is it so easy to commit such a fraud?”

Tackling cases of abandonment is complex and time-consuming. Abandoned wives and their lawyers have to liaise with local police departments, India’s ministry of external affairs and embassies and consulates across the world.

Activists say men rarely appear for court hearings in India, and summons issued by Indian courts often don’t reach the recipient, held up in the Indian high commissions and embassies abroad.

“Without a proper divorce, women can’t remarry and live with stigma. But the man continues to live without any repercussions even though he has a criminal case against him in India,” says Geetha Morla, founder of UK Women Empowerment Network (UKWen), a charity helping abandoned wives.

“These men have no humanity. In many cases, they have left their wife and child without any alimony or maintenance. But no one can force them to go back. I don’t know how this will be solved, we have really struggled to address this.”

Activists say Indian high commissions and embassies need to do more. The Indian government provides financial assistance to women stranded overseas, but there is no help with litigation, getting the accused to India, extradition or impounding the passport of the accused.

When Reddy discovered Kumar’s secret family, he imprisoned her in the house and cut off access to finances. Unaware of her rights in the UK, she was scared of being deported without her child. She had no social network to turn to. Eventually, she was able to contact her family, who helped her leave the country with her child.

Reddy was forced to get a restraining order against Kumar, who made death threats. She is now back in the UK seeking a divorce and child contact arrangements, which are proceeding well. She is also suing Kumar in India for demanding money from her for her dowry. This case is stuck in judicial and bureaucratic limbo. Kumar has not appeared at court hearings in India.

“He lives freely and I live in fear. Will he ever be punished for what he did to me?”

The report by three migrant rights groups has collected police data and analysed more than 1,000 criminal cases brought by prosecutors against refugees accused of driving vessels carrying asylum seekers across the Mediterranean.

The report by Arci Porco Rosso, the NGO Alarm Phone, and the nonprofit Borderline Sicilia, found evidence of police officers offering immigration papers and other incentives to migrants to persuade them to testify against the suspected boat drivers, who, in some cases were asylum seekers forced at gunpoint by traffickers to navigate refugee boats.

The NGOs claim the new evidence in the report confirms that Italy has spent decades pursuing a policy of criminalising asylum seekers, alleging prosecutors have been filling its prisons with innocent men used as scapegoats.

“We have examined over 1,000 court cases, spoken to hundreds of people involved,” the report stated. “We spoke to persons accused of boat driving, lawyers, judges and members of the police and coastguard, to reveal the full extent of Italy’s process of criminalising migration.”

Using police data and evidence presented in hundreds of court cases, the report revealed how refugees were targeted for prosecution.

Before sending a boat to Italy, from Libya, Tunisia, or Turkey, the report said smugglers often choose a migrant as a driver. This can be someone who does not have enough money to pay for the trip or with experience of navigation.

When the boat enters Italian waters, the authorities ask passengers to identify the driver, who is then arrested.

Boat drivers, who often come from war-torn countries, are accused of crimes, from illegally piloting migrant boats to the country, to trafficking in migrants, to criminal association. They can face sentences from 15 years to life in prison.

Although in several court cases judges have recognised the “state of necessity” – that the unlawful conduct is justified to protect the perpetrator or another person from imminent and serious danger – hundreds of cases are currently making their way through Italy’s legal system.

Since 2013, at least 24 people have received sentences of more than 10 years, while six have been given life sentences, according to the report.

“This happens when, unfortunately, during the journey, some of the passengers die,” said Maria Giulia Fava at Arci Porco Rosso. ‘‘In that case, the boat driver is charged with murder. It is in those moments that justice is transformed into a terrible machine that risks destroying the lives of these people forever.”

Four Libyan professional footballers were arrested in Sicily in 2015 and sentenced to 30 years after 49 people died during a sea crossing. The men’s families and friends said they were refugees fleeing the civil war to continue their careers in Germany and were forced to pilot the boat. Last year, Libyan warlord Gen Khalifa Haftar reportedly refused to release 18 Italian fishers accused of illegally fishing in Libyan territorial waters until Italy had freed the footballers. But the move was unsuccessful.

Italian prosecutors’ use of anti-mafia laws in the cases of migrant boat drivers, which the report said has been framed as a continuation of the country’s prolonged battle against organised crime, has led to hundreds of boat drivers facing draconian charges, such as criminal association.

Evidence in the report appears to show that in some instances police have offered incentives to migrants to identify those driving the boat as being part of smuggling operations.

“In one case a Nigerian witness told us that the police officers promised him that, by providing an accusatory statement [against a boat driver], he would be allowed to go to school and have a bed in a hostel,”, said the report. “Sometimes, the same thing happens with translators, who are asked by the authorities to find the boat drivers among the other passengers.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/oct/14/egypt-accused-of-disruption-as-giuliano-regeni-trial-begins,"['kidnapping', 'suspends', 'italian', 'authorities', 'men', 'proceedings', 'defendants', 'court', 'giulio', 'security', 'regeni', 'murder', 'egyptian', 'officials', 'trial']","A court in Rome has suspended trial proceedings against four Egyptian security officials accused of kidnapping, torturing and murdering the Italian student Giulio Regeni in Cairo, following hours of deliberation over whether it is fair for the men to be tried in absentia.

The trial was returned to a preliminary court, after judges debated for seven hours about whether hearings could continue amid any doubt they were aware of proceedings against them.

Regeni, a 28-year-old doctoral student, went missing in Cairo on 25 January 2016 while researching Egypt’s unions. His body was discovered on an outlying Cairo highway nine days later, displaying signs of extreme torture and abuse.

Prosecutors argued fiercely that the four defendants, all current or former employees of Egypt’s National Security Agency, should be tried in absentia in Rome, after Egyptian authorities blocked efforts to officially notify the four men about trial proceedings.

A lower court will now resume attempts to contact the four defendants. Observers fear that suspending trial proceedings could effectively annul the trial due to Egypt’s unwillingness to cooperate.

“There has been a strategy from the National Security Agency of Egypt to keep the four defendants away from Italian jurisdiction and protect them,” said Sergio Colaiocco, head of the Rome prosecution.

Egyptian officials, the prosecutors said, ignored more than 30 official requests through diplomatic channels and years of repeated requests by the Italian prosecution to provide the men’s addresses, required to officially inform defendants of trials under Italian law.

Gen Tariq Saber, Col Aser Ibrahim, Capt Hesham Helmi, and Maj Magdi Abd al-Sharif are accused of the “aggravated kidnapping” of Regeni, who disappeared in January 2016 in Cairo while researching labour unions, a politically sensitive subject in the eyes of the Egyptian authorities. All four defendants face a sentence of up to eight years for kidnap, while Sharif could receive a life sentence for “conspiracy to commit aggravated murder”.

The Italian prime minister’s office announced it would join efforts by state prosecutors and the Regeni family to try the four security officials the day before the hearing. Italy previously said it would seek to extradite anyone convicted during the trial proceedings. The trial caps years of diplomatic tension over the young researcher’s murder, despite recent moves including arms sales that demonstrated warmer relations between the two countries.

The initial hearing took place in a courtroom lined with cells, attached to a high-security facility built to try members of the mafia. Prosecutors argued that Egyptian officials’ efforts to ignore a deluge of requests to inform the security officials about the trial followed years of efforts to misdirect the Italian authorities and prevent any investigation into the murder. Arguing that it was highly improbable that four members of the Egyptian security state would be unaware of legal proceedings against them, they said Egyptian authorities had deliberately sought to disrupt the trial by stonewalling repeated efforts to contact the men.

Italian prosecutors previously said they sought to indict 13 more people, but that silence from the Egyptian side stopped them from gathering sufficient evidence to do so. The trial represents a rare opportunity to seek accountability from Egypt’s powerful security services, who are accused by rights groups of human rights abuses.

“The Egyptian attitude has been like a wall, one that has not allowed us to investigate further,” said Francesco Romeo, a lawyer for the prosecution. “We are talking about authorities in a country that has tried in every way to misdirect Italian procedures to find the truth, a systematic organised way to avoid being involved in this whole story. This is illegal in Italy, to misdirect police investigations.”

A team of court-appointed lawyers representing each of the defendants argued that a trial in absentia was unjust, and that proceedings should be halted until Italy could guarantee the defendants had recognised the trial or officially refused to attend.

“It’s not the National Security Agency on trial. We should focus not on whether the NSA was informed [about proceedings], but if these four individuals had information and chose not to be here today voluntarily,” said Annalisa Ticconi, the defence lawyer for Sharif, during the hearing. She claimed that Italy risked European sanctions for its insistence on trying the men in absentia.

“Going on with this trial without ensuring these men are notified makes Italy no different from Egypt,” said Tranquillino Sarno, representing Aser Ibrahim in court. “Without collaboration of the Egyptian authorities this trial cannot be held … You are witnessing a trial against Egypt.”

Egypt closed its own investigation into Regeni’s murder in late 2020, claiming that the real killer is still unknown. Egypt’s public prosecutors attacked Rome’s investigation in a statement soon after, claiming that the Italian side lacked the evidence to convict the men, and rejecting any involvement by their security officials in Regeni’s disappearance or murder.

Prosecutors argued the Egyptian authorities claimed Regeni was a spy, attempting to frame his work and travels as politically suspect while tampering with vital video evidence and mobile phone data requested by the Italian side.

They outlined how Egypt impeded Italian efforts to investigate Regeni’s murder from the day his body was found on an outlying Cairo highway in 2016. Alessandra Ballerini, who represents the Regeni family, described his extensive injuries, including broken bones, broken teeth, and letters carved into his skin by his torturers.

One of the accused men, Aser Ibrahim, headed the investigation into Regeni’s murder from the Egyptian side. “So they actually investigated themselves,” said Colaiocco.

Ballerini described how she was detained by the NSA and questioned on arrival in Cairo in 2017 while working on the case, and how the Regeni family’s Egyptian legal team endured years of abuse due to their work, including detention and torture of their members.

She added that at one point, the pressure from inside Egypt to thwart the investigation was so intense that NSA officials asked the Egyptian legal team to refer their work to the NSA for inspection.

“They said they will not act as informants, and were told there will be repercussions against them and their families,” she said. “When they asked what that meant, they answered ‘ask Giulio’.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/chinas-booming-real-estate-market-could-spell-trouble-for-the-economy,"['spell', 'real', 'housing', 'cities', 'market', 'boom', 'end', 'estate', 'trouble', 'chinas', 'china', 'debt', 'sector', 'economy', 'property']","In China today, the buzz is all about how the government there too has stumbled into an energy crisis with widespread power cuts. Yet this and other supply shocks will eventually pass, while the $300bn (£218bn) of debt enveloping China’s second biggest property developer, Evergrande, is of greater significance. It suggests China’s long housing boom is over, and bodes badly for the increasingly troubled economy, with implications for the rest of the world too.

China’s real estate market has been called the most important sector in the world economy. Valued at about $55tn, it is now twice the size of its US equivalent, and four times larger than China’s GDP. Taking into account construction and other property-related goods and services, annual housing activity accounts for about 29% of China’s GDP, far above the 10%-20% typical of most developed nations.

Real estate busts can be as painful as the preceding booms were exuberant. China, however, has only known growth as its previous housing welfare system was transformed from the 1990s onwards. A protracted housing downturn is now poised to add to the Chinese economy’s other mounting headwinds, with significant and unpredictable implications.

The signs were there 10 years ago, when the spotlight fell on China’s “ghost cities”. One of the most publicised was the Kangbashi district of the city of Ordos in Inner Mongolia, famed for its gleaming but empty office blocks and apartment towers, barren boulevards, deserted highways, and vacant shops and plazas. However, ghost cities turned out to be more bad investment than overinvestment. Ordos and similar cities remained eyesores for a while but have since filled up a bit.

Aside from ghost cities, the property sector prospered in the 2000s and 2010s because Beijing not only appeared to want a maturing real-estate market, but promoted it hard to underpin growth and the formation of a propertied, urban middle class. Developers had no qualms about borrowing heavily, because credit was freely available and they felt the government would always support the market if needed.

By the time the pandemic struck in 2020, it had certainly become a case of overinvestment. About a fifth of China’s housing units now lie vacant, often because they are too expensive for the population, 40% of whom earn barely 1,000 yuan (£115) a month. For second and third homes, the vacancy rates are higher still.

Meanwhile, since 2017, Beijing’s attitude towards rampant credit creation and the financialisation of housing – treating it as a commodity rather than as somewhere to live – has undergone a sea change. Xi Jinping told that year’s Communist party congress that “houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation”, and that action would be taken to curb demand, overbuilding and rising home prices. Tighter mortgage terms and restrictions on multiple-home ownership followed.

Last year, regulators tightened regulations on developers designed to curb debt, preserve cash, and limit overbuilding. The government is sensitive to high housing costs, which are deemed to be excessive and a disincentive to larger family size. The crackdown chimes with its recent “common prosperity” drive, ostensibly designed to address rampant inequality, which has also seen a regulatory clampdown on big tech firms such as Alibaba, Didi and Tencent.

Those changes have exposed the financial fragility of developers and moved the precarious housing bubble centre stage. Even if, as seems likely, the Chinese authorities can keep the fallout from Evergrande from becoming a Lehman-type shock, a downturn in the property and construction sector could well aggravate China’s looming economic slowdown. Some expect China’s growth rate to slide to 1%-2%, for a while at least.

Banks and property companies are likely to restrict building activity and financing as they restructure broken balance sheets and Chinese households will be wary about taking on new mortgages. Household debt has risen from about $2tn in 2010 to more than $10tn last year, with the ratio of debt to disposable income surging to about 130%, significantly higher than in the US. With incomes rising only slowly, especially in the gig or informal economy, which now accounts for about three-fifths of employment, households are likely to remain on the back foot.

Demographics, especially the low 1.3 fertility rate, are also working against the economy. China’s working age and main home buying age groups are declining. The number of prime-age, first-time homebuyers – those in the 25-39 bracket – is set to fall by 25% in the next 20 years from 327 million to 247 million. The urbanisation rate, moreover, which doubled to 64% between 1996 and 2020, is bound to slow. There will be fewer marriages, fewer children and lower household formation.

In the last 10 to 15 years, local and provincial governments could always be relied upon to boost real estate and infrastructure spending to get the economy out of a hole if needed. They are already heavily in debt, however, and under pressure to find resources to support Xi’s “common prosperity” programme.

It is harder to predict what will happen to home prices in China. If they do, for the first time, decline far or over any length of time, expect to see much bigger problems emerge for banks and for consumers as negative wealth effects spread among the urban population.

We do not know how well China will manage to wean itself off real estate construction and services, but it will not be easy or painless. There will be important consequences for China’s economy, possibly its leadership, and the way China projects its influence abroad. Stay tuned."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/why-britons-are-tolerating-sky-high-covid-rates-and-why-this-may-not-last,"['health', 'public', 'tolerating', 'skyhigh', 'normal', 'britons', 'covid', 'steady', 'deaths', 'rates', 'university', 'west', 'current', 'uk']","It is one of the conundrums of the current phase of the Covid pandemic: the UK has among the highest number of infections across the world and a death toll that continues to steadily climb, yet the national mood seems sanguine. So is this down to British stoicism, a Keep Calm and Carry on mentality?

Not according to experts. They talk of many factors being at play – and warn it may not last.

“We’re in a phase where we still have large numbers of people dying from this disease,” said Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh. “But it has gone into the background. We’ve become used to something that has not gone away. I think there’s been a desensitisation to the mortality.”

On Thursday, the UK reported more than 45,000 new coronavirus cases – the most since mid-July – and more than 800 deaths were reported in the past seven days. Hospitalisations are rising, with one-fifth of ICU beds occupied by Covid patients, and the latest figures showed an estimated 200,000 pupils absent from school.

The UK is faring far worse than its European neighbours, with a rate of deaths per million people nearly triple those seen in France, Germany and Italy.

However, the figures are still better than some predictions; Sage scientists said October could see 7,000 hospitalisations a day

In any case, it is not all about the statistics.

“When the Covid announcements were made, they’d say ‘Very sadly, three people have died’, then it was ‘Very sadly 70 have died’,” said Prof Robert West, a behavioural scientist at University College London.

“Now they don’t say ‘Very sadly’. One thing we know about humans is our emotions are stirred by images, they’re not stirred by numbers.”

Bauld believes current attitudes have been shaped by the “Freedom Day narrative” – the social contract made between the government and the public that if people came forward for vaccines, life would return to normal. “A lot of people have bought into that,” she said.

This includes some scientists. “There’s some who are of the view that Covid is becoming endemic, it was always going to become endemic and we just need to get on with it,” said Bauld.

“Then we’ve got another group of scientists saying ‘Look around the world at other countries that won’t tolerate such high rates of infection, and what about long Covid?’”

Growing division in the community means that scientists are no longer providing a coherent argument – and to some extent the government can pick and choose which views it amplifies.

Is there something particular to the British psyche – a stiff upper lip, an internalising of angst – that makes the country appear relatively unshaken by the ongoing toll of the pandemic?

“There definitely isn’t,” said West. “The British are much more safety conscious than most other countries when you look at driving, health and safety at work, the way we approach public health.

“This is something that is conditioned by the norms we see around us. When our leaders talk about Covid in the past tense, it gets through to people.”

A steady state

As a disease shifts from an initial pandemic phase to an endemic illness, the data curves outlining its spread become less precipitous. And psychologists say this steady stream of daily deaths – although the UK is now on an upwards trajectory – tends to feel less alarming than the rises we witnessed in the first year of the pandemic.

“We’re built to react to change. We don’t react to steady state,” said West. “Something will have to change in people’s psyche to make people feel like we need to do more about it.”

This may have been reflected in the health secretary’s apparent lack of concern when asked on Thursday about the continuing high rates of infection. “Overall things feel quite stable at this point. The numbers are a bit up, a bit down over the last few weeks,” Sajid Javid told Times Radio.

According to West, accepting steady state is a question of framing. “There are steady states that appear troubling for humans,” he said. “By virtue of the fact that’s it going to go on and on … the public may start saying: ‘We can’t keep having 1,000 deaths a week.’”

A possible trigger for such a reappraisal may be the continued strain on the NHS. Hospitals may not be “overwhelmed”but figures released this week showed that 5.7 million people were on waiting lists at the end of August, the highest figure since records began in 2007.

“We’re not back to normal, it’s as simple as that,” said Prof Tim Cook, a consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine. With about 20% of ICU beds and 10% of hospital beds occupied by Covid patients, there is no prospect of an imminent return to business as usual.

“That proportion will continue to slowly occupy hospital beds for many weeks or months to come,” Cook said. “I don’t see an end to this level of occupancy for quite some time.

However, there is disagreement even among health professionals about what an acceptable “steady state” would be for Covid.

“Some still support a zero Covid model, with an aim of having no cases, while others are accepting of the current situation, in which we have about 40,000 cases,” said Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians.

“We have all accepted – doctors included – 10,000 deaths from flu each year so this tells us much about what we might accept with regard to Covid, although the impact on the most deprived parts of society and on certain ethnic minorities may reduce tolerance for such levels.”

The new normal?

It is not yet clear where the UK public sits on this continuum and some push back at the notion that there is an acceptance of the current situation.

“The idea that everyone is accepting the new normal is very dangerous,” said Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews. “Then you reinforce a sense of fatalism.”

Reicher points to a wealth of evidence in psychology showing that our behaviour can be shaped to a greater extent by what we think others think than by our own beliefs. “If your attitude is at odds with a perceived social norm, you’re less likely to act on it,” he said.

According to Reicher, the government has been “systematically normalising” the UK’s current rate of infections.

“They’ve been acting like this is inevitable, seeming relaxed about infections going up,” he said. “People often want a generic psychological explanation, but we mustn’t ignore the political and ideological context in which this is happening. We’re looking at a phenomenon of normalisation.”

A powerful way of normalising a situation is to explain it through natural phenomenon, for instance putting the ongoing spread of Covid down to the virulent properties of the Delta variant.

The media also plays a role in setting a perception of what is “normal”, according to Reicher. “[Research shows] that the media changes virtually nobody’s mind,” he said. “But it changes people’s belief about what others think.”

The most recent surveys show that the public retain cautious attitudes on Covid safety. However, there is a widening gap between attitudes and behaviours.

To some, the lack of public reaction to the ongoing death rate is bewildering. “It feels very surreal that we are just accepting the current infection rates. No one is making a fuss about it, but well over 100 people are dying every day due to Covid,” said Kit Yates, a senior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Bath.

Yates points out that, while vaccination has changed the outcome of high Covid rates, having so much virus in circulation is not without consequence.

“The current death rate is equivalent to over 40,000 people a year dying of Covid. This is not normal,” he said.

“The government has abandoned all pretence at public health measures to control Covid. It’s a national scandal, but one which seems to have largely slipped from view.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/13/will-chinas-plan-to-build-more-coal-plants-derail-cop26,"['climate', 'emissions', 'power', 'derail', 'plan', 'build', 'coal', 'cop26', 'plants', 'chinas', 'china', 'xi', 'world', 'global', 'energy']","China’s decision to build more coal plants is a setback for climate action, but analysts say it could still meet its long-term emission reduction targets and may even have scope to raise its ambition at Cop26 in Glasgow.

In recent days, Beijing has announced a buildup of coal capacity to address the most severe power cuts in a decade, which have caused rolling blackouts in half its provinces.

This is of global concern, because China is by far the biggest source of carbon dioxide with 29% of all emissions, more than the other G20 countries combined. If China cannot kick its addiction to coal, the world has no chance of reaching the Paris agreement goal of keeping global heating to well below 2C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and premier, Li Keqiang, have made it clear that domestic energy security and economic development take priority. The government has ordered coalmines to increase production and made the first new coal-fired power plant announcement in more than a year.

At first sight, this seems at least a softening of China’s commitment to the climate cause, like a horrible case of deja-vu, a throwback to the first decade of the century when China was building new and bigger furnaces every week to power an economy growing at double-digit speed. It appears to complicate Beijing’s commitment to peak its emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2060. Some commentators fear it could jeopardise Cop26, because China is key to a successful outcome.

Q&A What is Cop26? Show For almost three decades, world governments have met nearly every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), every country on Earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC. This year is the 26th iteration, postponed by a year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow.

The conference will officially open on 31 October, and more than 120 world leaders will gather in the first few days. They will then depart, leaving the complex negotiations to their representatives, mainly environment ministers or similarly senior officials. About 25,000 people are expected to attend the conference in total. The talks are scheduled to end at 6pm on Friday 12 November. Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Veteran analysts, however, believe these fears are overblown. While the short-term consequences for global emissions are grim, in the long term this is likely to be a wobble rather than a fall. China, they say, can still hold to a positive course.

There are four main reasons for this less gloomy outlook. First, they say, the causes of China’s power cuts have been widely misunderstood. The energy crunch has little or nothing to do with pressure from climate policy. Coal supply has failed to meet demand largely because of price controls and policy missteps. If anything, this energy crunch has amplified the benefits of renewables, which are less vulnerable to market volatility.

Second, increased coal capacity is not the same as increased coal consumption, notes Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst and China watcher at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. China can strengthen energy security with more coalmines and plants, but not all of this will need to be used if renewables take an increasing share of electricity generation. Xi , in his speech this week at the Kunming UN conference on biodiversity, emphasised that this would continue to be the case.

Third, Xi has reaffirmed China’s existing international commitment to achieve the “dual carbon goals” for 2030 and 2060. Rather than diluting his commitment, he framed it forcefully as a pragmatic and ambitious step to “upgrade the economy”.

Fourth, the climate remains a focus of diplomatic activity and is central to discussions with the US, the UK and Europe. At the conclusion of the EU-China climate and environment dialogue in 2020, China confirmed it would submit an upgraded national plan to the UN before the Glasgow summit.

00:39 China to stop building new coal-fired power projects abroad, says Xi Jinping – video

The contents will be crucial. At successive climate talks, China’s influence has increased along with its greenhouse gases, which have tripled in 30 years. China is due to release two key domestic documents – a long-term framework and an action plan for the next 10 years. If they are unambitious, 1.5C will be impossible. If they show higher ambition, then Glasgow will suddenly seem a much more hopeful place.

Qin Yan, lead analyst at the financial data provider Refinitiv, said the newly announced increase in coal capacity restricted China’s scope for more ambition up to 2025, but that longer-term improvements were still possible. “I had hoped China would announce a cap of coal consumption, but this difficult now,” she said. “But I believe China may bring forward the year when emissions will peak. Domestic experts have suggested this may be possible in 2028. I have run the numbers and I also think that is possible.”

A strong signal is desperately needed. In spring, China’s CO 2 emissions grew at their fastest pace in more than a decade as leaders tried to bounce back from the coronavirus lockdown with a splurge of investment in cement, steel and fossil fuels. The coal-fleet capacity rose by almost 30 gigawatts, outweighing all the cuts in the rest of the world.

Relations with the US are also more complicated, marked by discord over Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea. Despite this, Xi participated in Joe Biden’s climate summit earlier this year and the two leaders made near simultaneous announcements of big climate steps at last month’s UN general assembly. Biden unveiled a plan to double climate support for poorer nations to $11.4bn, which will help to maintain international unity. Hours later, Xi promised to halt Chinese funding of overseas coal projects, which bought the world about three extra months to reach net zero."

In early 2021, my research team was analysing a new drug called ivermectin. In the first clinical trials, this drug seemed to prevent new infections and improve survival. When I first wrote about this, I started getting regular threats on Twitter, demanding that ivermectin should be approved worldwide and questioning the safety of vaccines.

In March 2021, I received my first vaccine dose and posted a photo on Twitter from the clinic. Within minutes I was receiving strange messages: “Why would you do that?”, “not safe”, “why not use ivermectin instead”, “you are paid by the Gates Foundation”. One person even sent a link to a suction device to remove the vaccine fluid from my arm. Any message I sent promoting the benefits of vaccines led to threats and abuse.

However, we then found several examples of medical fraud in the clinical trials of ivermectin: some of the databases had been simply made up by unscrupulous doctors. When we filtered out all the poor-quality clinical trials, there was no longer any clinical benefit for ivermectin.

After we reported on the medical fraud in July 2021, the abuse became much worse. I was sent images of Nazi war criminals hanging from lamp-posts, Voodoo images of swinging coffins, vivid threats that my family were not safe, that we would all burn in hell. This was happening most days – I opened my laptop in the morning to be confronted with a sea of hate and disturbing threats. Twitter did nothing after I reported these threats. So I had to shut down social media.

There were also threats to my scientific reputation on email. I know many other scientists who have been threatened and abused in similar ways after promoting vaccination or questioning the benefits of unproven treatments like ivermectin. If scientists cannot communicate for fear of threats and abuse, how can all the misinformation be controlled?

If we allow this misinformation to be spread unchecked, there is a real danger that people won’t get vaccinated – they will believe that they can take an alternative treatment and be protected, even if there is no real proof. These people could then get infected, hospitalised and even die of Covid. There are so many unvaccinated patients being hospitalised in the UK, when they could have made a different choice with the right information.

A Twitter spokesperson said: “Abuse and harassment have no place on our service. Our investments in proactive technology continue to reduce the burden on people to report to Twitter by surfacing more content for review. More than 65% of tweets we take action on for abuse are now proactively surfaced using technology, rather than relying on reports to Twitter.”
